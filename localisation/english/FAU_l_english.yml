FAU_ceres_fauna: "Ceres Fauna"
FAU_ceres_fauna_desc: "Fauna is a symbol of the Irish, a central figure in the struggle for dominance in the island. She is a moderate, a figure which all can look to during a time of crisis and struggle. She stands between the radical Irish Antis and between the eternally encroaching British power. Fauna is a popular figure among the majority of the Irish, who align with her views and see her as a manifestation of the Irish beliefs made into physical form. Her Agrarian, pro-rural beliefs, and support of Irish self-determination cause many to support her, although she is less known outside of Ireland itself. Fauna represents the free and hearty spirit of the Irish common people, the same people she leads into the coming era.\n\nBefore the outbreak of the great war and the Hololive revolts, Fauna pushed for ideas of peace and prosperity, ideas which were put to the test by the Teammate Revolt led by Watson. When the revolution began, Fauna and her supporters found themselves caught between the crossfire of the IRA, the British government, and the Watson Teammates. Fauna led her supporters through the difficulty and flame of the civil war. The British were expelled, the IRA was pushed back into the shadows, followed by a truce between Fauna's Irish rebels and Watsons Unionist forces. Bruggs resolved the conflict once and for all, ruling that Northern Ireland would remain with London, under Watson, while the rest of the island would be held by Fauna and the Irish.\n\nFauna led the Irish through years of success after Bruggs, as she taught them new Agrarian methods and blessed their crop harvests. Ireland largely drew away from international affairs in this period, preferring small, agrarian isolationism rather than the bustling and foreign world outside, with the exception of Fauna joining the LHS and occasional meetings with Watson. This continued for some time, until the conflicts that wracked Britannia and her sister isle in 1931.\n\nThe English Rebellion inspired uprisings in Scotland and Ireland, prompting the return of a demon that many had hoped banished, the IRA. The IRA rose from the shadows, a vast wave of Irish Antis that swept across the land, nearly displacing Fauna entirely from the island. Only when Fauna opened herself to the LHS and their forces did they retake much of the island, forcing back the IRA to small holds on the island. The economic impact of the great scare, though, forced the LHS to withdraw most of their forces. Fauna negotiated a ceasefire between the two factions, which only barely held the island in a state of uneasy peace, with minor skirmishes and attacks occurring often. Will Fauna be able to maintain peace on these islands? Or will she finally unify this island under the Irish banner once more?"
