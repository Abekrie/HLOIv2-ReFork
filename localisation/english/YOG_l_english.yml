YOG_yogiri_desc: "Yogiri is the pro-democracy republican governor of Shaanxi province. She works to keep a strong and independent Shaanxi, working alongside Yan Xishan and is a pro-LHS figure in the former Hololie China Council.\n\nYogiri was part of the original Hololive China branch council members who governed over the entirety of China, where she controlled a good portion of Central China. As the Council descended into civil war, Yogiri withdrew from the Council and focused on centralizing Shaanxi. When the Japanese invaded, her province was on the frontlines and she was the first Hololive China member to provide a base of operations for Gura as she was pro-LHS. After the war however she was relegated to being the governor of Shaanxi when Gura took the chief leadership position in China.\n\nDespite being backstabbed by Gura and the LHS, Yogiri is still very pro-LHS and pro-democracy. She cooperated with Yan Xishan to strengthen Shaanxi and one day seeks to liberate China from centuries of authoritarian oppression and implement a true republican system."
