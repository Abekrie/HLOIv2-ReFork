WTS_amelia_watson_desc:0 "Ending up in colonial South Africa in 1899, Watson found herself in the position of a nurse within the British Army which was knees deep in the ongoing Boer War. After the Battle of the Modder River where over 400 troops were wounded, she crafted the 'Watson Concoction' which proved to be highly effective. Due to her actions in the war, she was awarded the Royal Red Cross and the Order of Merit.\n Through her many contacts made during the war, Watson was welcomed in Britain wholeheartedly and soon emerged as a political figure. In 1906 she formally established a dining club known as the 'Teammates' where they would discuss contemporary issues within the Empire. Although Watson herself was never able to run as an MP, she still held influence over parliamentarians who would push her messages of Hololive Idealism and the Hololive Republic.\n During the Great War, Teammates organizations were prohibited and the British Home Guard and Public Order Authority was established to curb dissent. This ultimately failed however as when ceasefire between the Central Powers and the Entente INCOMPLETE"

WTS_ira_presence_loc:0 "\nThe IRA, Irish Republican Army, although in practice a variety of different groups, is an organisation which is anti-Watson, anti-Fauna and supports the full unification of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The group has had a prolonged struggle against English rule and continues to be a major headache for the Watson regime."
WTS_bgc_presence:0 "Elevated BGC Presence"
WTS_bgc_presence_loc:0 "\nThe Byddin Gweriniaeth Cymru, or Welsh Republican Army, was a violent group that emerged from the ashes of the Great War in defiance to the Watson regime and previous Welsh nationalist movements which were primarily focused on a revival of Welsh culture. As the economic situation for the Watson regime worsened and nationalist strife began to dramatically increase, many flocked to the BGC and even revolted against their Hololive overlords in the 1931 Revolution. However, they were quickly driven underground where they continue to attack all those who oppose their aims."
WTS_english_antis_presence:0 "Elevated English-Antis Presence"
WTS_english_antis_presence_loc:0 "\nAlthough many fled northwards to join the revolution in 1931, a large portion of Antis remained in the South and Midlands. Once the revolution was over however, much of those who were left behind in Watson territory resorted to more extreme acts of insurrection. Due to support in the form of manpower and weapons from all over the isle, the English Anti cells in Watson territory are deadly and a force to reckon with; even in ther small and disorganized bands."
WTS_national_protection_league:0 "National Teammates League"
WTS_national_protection_league_loc:0 "\nFormed in reaction to the IRA, the National Teammates League is a group of pro-Watson paramilitaries that aims to defend all citizen. Behind this notion of defence, the NTL essentially fights a war against the IRA, BGC and English Antis whom they see as the ultimate enemy and have no qualms in resorting to aggressive acts of violence against."
