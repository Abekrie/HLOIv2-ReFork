ANY_anya_melfissa: "Anya Melfissa"
ANY_anya_melfissa_desc: "Melfissa Anya is the sole ruler of the small island of Timor on the very edges of the Indonesian islands. She runs a large scale gambling den on the island that works to play off many sides of the Indonesian conflict.\n\nAnya originally was part of a Timor independence movement early in her arrival to the past and was funded by both the LHS and the Portuguese to fight the Dutch. The Portuguese expected Anya to be weakened and rule Timor under a weak rule so they could take over the island but she won the uprising and secured Timor for herself. She eventually joined the 2nd Indonesian Republic for funding to develop Timor but was largely ignored by her peers, causing her to leave. To find alternative income she create a large scale gambling and casino industry on the island that made her rich. However, the onset of the Great Depression hasn't been kind on her economy.\n\nAnya must deal with the ongoing effects of the Great Depression and revitalize her casino industry. The current situation in Indonesia presents a great opportunity for profits if she can play the IDs off each other."
