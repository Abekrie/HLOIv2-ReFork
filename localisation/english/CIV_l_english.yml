CIV_civia: "Civia"
CIV_civia_desc: "	Civia is the governor of Sichuan province. She maintains an isolationist foreign policy and focuses heavily on the internal development of Sichuan, seeking to build its provincial identity. She distrusts the entire LHS system and even other members of the former Hololive China council.\n\nCivia was part of the original Hololive China branch council members who governed over the entirety of China, with her ruling over Sichuan province. She pushed against Artia's pro-Han Chinese policies and fought against Artia during the collapse of the HoloCN council. In the war against the Japanese, Civia's forces made up 40% of Hololive China's military and after the war withdrew back to Sichuan.\n\nCivia needs to complete her modernization of Sichuan that was interrupted by the Japanese invasion and eventually make a decision whether to continue to isolate Sichuan or take on the task of unifying China."
