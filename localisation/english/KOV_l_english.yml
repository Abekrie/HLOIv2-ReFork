KOV_kaela_kovalskia: "Kaela Kovalskia"
KOV_kaela_kovalskia_desc: "Kovalskia Kaela is the dictator of Madagascar. Under her rule, the key settlements of Madagascar quickly industrialized and are a major naval power in the Indian Ocean.\n\nKaela was accidentally sent back to Madagascar instead of Indonesia due to too many internal jokes during time travel. She ended up being worshiped by the Malagasy as a queen and led an anti-French independence movement that restored a monarchy to the island. Under her rule, she pushed the island towards heavy industrialization, creating a giant shipping industry and a fairly powerful navy. Kaela largely ignored the LHS and instead aligned herself with the Aqua Resistance who provided much industrial equipment and military training.\n\nKaela must seek to build stronger relations with the Resistance in this polarizing world, and with the outbreak of civil war in Indonesia she must choose whether to return home to assert her dominance or look to expanding into East Africa to carve out a new empire."
