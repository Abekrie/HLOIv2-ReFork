PEK_lone_rabbit:0 "Lone Rabbit"
PEK_lone_rabbit_desc:0 "Pekora remains isolated from the rest of Europe due to her anti-LHS policy which strongly pits her against the Great Powers of the region. Although sympathetic rulers such as Flare, Miko and Suisei exist, they are hesitant or unable to openly support Pekora's regime due to the potential consequences. However, this isolation has led to a strong nationalist and irredentist fervor amongst the army; only adding to the Gloria trasmite il Coraggio doctrine that had spread amongst all levels of society."
PEK_esercito_santa_fede_idea:0 "Armata della Restaurazione della Santa Fede"
PEK_esercito_santa_fede_idea_desc:0 "The Armata della Restaurazione della Santa Fede (Army for the Restoration of the Holy Faith), was founded as soon as Pekora's intentions of secularisation and revolution were made aware to the strongly Catholic nation of Italy. Particularly in the more traditionalist and monarchist South, they strongly reisted Pekora's 'republican terror' and had gone so far as to assassinate the then PM, Giovanni Giolitti in 1922. With church sermons becoming more and more radical in their opposition to the Usada Republic, the regime stepped in and arrested dissident priests. This only fueled the movement however as open revolt began to break out throughout the country. Despite continued efforts to stomp the ARSF, they still terrorize the countryside and call for the reinstating of the House of Savoy."
PEK_islamic_support:0 "Strong Islamic Support"
PEK_islamic_support_desc:0 "Despite initial resistance, Pekora had gained support in Libya and Tunisia amongst Sufi muslims throughout the 1920s due to her lenience towards them. Thus when the invasion of Egypt began, it was not seen as just another colonial conquest but rather as a liberation of Muslims from the Godless liberal regime there. Now, with new support from the Mahdists in the recently acquired Sudan and other radicals across the Middle East, it's likely that further expansion into the region is inevitable."
PEK_pekora_construction:0 "Usada Kensetsu"
PEK_pekora_construction_desc:0 "Usada Kensetsu was founded in 1923 as the 25th corporation in the Usada Republic which focused on the development goals outlines by the [NEW DAWN PLAN]. Once the campaign had largely ended by the end of the decade, Usada Kensetsu remained but had re-oriented itself towards representing the state's interest in Africa via loans and investments. By 1935, the corporation had over 200,000 employees in varying fields from construction, to arms manufacturing, to even mercenaries."

PEK_mezzogiorno_loc:0 "\nThe Mezzogiorno is a region which has been the black spot of the Italian peninsular for years. Despite constant efforts to improve the region and expand the local industry, the funds put in seem to go missing and the projects which are funded often end up becoming unprofitable and state reliant."
