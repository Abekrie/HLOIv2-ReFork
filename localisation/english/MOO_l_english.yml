MOO_moona_hoshinova: "Moona Hoshinova"
MOO_moona_hoshinova_desc: "Hoshinova Moona is the former president of the 2nd Indonesian Republic and currently holds a strong central position in the Indonesia turmoil. She has strong leanings towards Pekora and the Usada Kensetsu, seeking to create a strong, independent corporatist Indonesia.\n\nMoona originally worked as a clerk under the Dutch colonial administration where she also kept in constant contact with Pekora who gave instructions on creating a mass movement for Indonesian liberation. With Pekora's assistance and her insider knowledge in the administration, Moona organized a large-scale revolt and played a major role in the Indonesian revolution that coincided with the Hololive Revolution. She played a major role in forming the 1st Indonesian Republic that quickly failed but helped reorganize into the 2nd Indonesian Republic under shaky grounds where she was voted in as the first president.\n\nThe result of Moona's presidency and pro-Pekora policies helped cause the breakdown of the 2nd Indonesian Republic. Due to her presidential powers and support from Usada Kensetsu, Moon is one of the most powerful forces in Indonesia, with her base of power in Borneo. She now must reunite the fractured republic to put her and Pekora's dream into action."
