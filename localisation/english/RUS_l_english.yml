RUS_uruha_rushia_desc: "Uruha Rushia inherited a broken landscape, continually plagued by political instability from the tumultuous days of the Russian Revolution. The stresses of overseeing her part of Russia in the midst of the Depression has not helped her psyche, and many antis along her polity's borders eagerly wait for lapses of weakness to make their plays.\n\nIt was not always like this, however. Once upon a time, Uruha Rushia was sent as part of a Hololiver delegation tasked with enlightening the Russian people on the principles of Yagooism. When the fires of revolution began ringing, Rushia played her part in the downfall of the old Romanov regime, replacing the imperial government with her own dynasty as a result. However, the spread of the revolution spurred many radicals into action, those who did not care for Hololivers and their idealistic messages. Rushia was then forced to engage in a multi-year long struggle against the nascent but growing Soviet movement, with these fires only dying down somewhat in 1928.\n\nRushia might have thought that by finally quelling the guerillas from her realm after 12 long years of fighting, there would be peace. Her efforts at promoting industrial and economic growth with the New Economic Deal also seemed to pay off. But then the Depression hit, and discontent began again. No matter what Rushia did, the anger was everywhere. And now these events have forced Rushia into a crisis. With the many factions under her kingdom now clamouring to expand their own influence to take advantage of these labours, Rushia has to decide how to combat these threats, from both within and without."
