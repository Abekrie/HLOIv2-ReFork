SOR_tokino_sora: "Tokino Sora"
SOR_tokino_sora_desc: "Tokino Sora, the revered Goddess, the “first born” of Hololive is the reigning monarch of Greece, or now known as “Southern Yagooslavia”. All Hololivers, be they members of the LHS, Resistance, or anyone in between respect the image of Sora and all that she represents as a veteran idol of Hololive.\n\nIn the 1900s, Sora was a politician in Greece who worked to spread Yagooism and pro-Hololive sentiment around the Balkans, and was the first to rise up in the Hololive Revolution in Athens. After the Treaty of Brugg, Sora worked closely with Yagoo to maintain the LHS's grip around the world but with frustration; she was consistently locked into dealing with local Balkan matters over global affairs and was unable to prevent the global fragmentation of the Hololive order. In the 1920s, she was even caught in a war with Korone due to nationalist politics in Greece, which she lost.\n\nSora currently still administers the autonomous southern region of Yagooslavia, obeying Yagoo's every order. However this goddess is getting sick of being a rubber stamp and wishes to actually take a crack at repairing the shattered LHS. If Sora was to seize power from Yagoo, she can perhaps have her way and bring order to the world."
