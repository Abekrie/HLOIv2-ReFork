 fubuki.23.a: "What a wonderful occasion!"

 fubuki.24.t: "Turmoil in the WFA"
 fubuki.24.d: "Fubuki and her cabinet have received numerous reports from the WFA.

 fubuki.24.a: "Make him reaffirm his oath."

 fubuki.33.t: "WFA Civil War"

Within her cabinet, Fubuki's ministers debated endlessly on whether they should let the war play out on its own, or if they should intervene by sending arms and aid to the loyalists."
 fubuki.33.a: "We must lend them our support!"
 fubuki.33.b: "We cannot afford to help them now. Let them be."

Allied with the Ingrians and Karelians, the Settlers often come into conflict with Russians who see them as part of the occupying forces. This conflict has resulted in the formation of paramilitaries which fight bandits and maintain the rule of law in far flung territories.\n\nA group of Russian free farmers have arrived in Stockholm to protest the action of the militias."
 fubuki.41.a: "Crush them? They're doing our job for us!"
 fubuki.41.b: "They can't be allowed to operate"
 fubuki.41.c: "Remove them, we'll double our patrols though"

 fubuki.42.t: "Russian Peasants Demand Support"
 fubuki.42.desc: "Since the Great War, peasants under the Russian occupied territories of the Empire have been suffering from banditry, devastation from the conflict, robber barons and environmental factors. A group of peasants from rural Russia has arrived in Stockholm to petition the government to take action to support the local population who teeter on the brink of starvation."
 fubuki.42.a: "We could make room in this quarter's budget"
 fubuki.42.b: "We simply don't have the funds"

 fubuki.43.t: "Land Reform Bill"
 fubuki.43.desc: "Unlike much of Russia, Fubuki's Russian lands have been dominated by large landowners who profited off of the region's devastation since the end of the Great War. Now Fubuki aims to push a land reform bill which would distribute lands to the peasants. Unlike many other bills passed to better integrate the territories into the Empire, this one has been met with overwhelming support from the local population"
 fubuki.43.a: "An easy win for the regime"

 fubuki.44.t: "Whistle Stop Tour"
 fubuki.44.desc: "Fubuki has decided to take a whistle stop tour across the Russian territories of the Empire to drum up support for the government's initiatives. This is the first time that the Queen has visited cities outside of Fubukistad during times of peace."
 fubuki.44.a: "Where is her next stop?"

 fubuki.45.t: "Mandatory Swedish Language"
 fubuki.45.desc: "In order to better integrate the numerous ethnicities in our armed forces, we must teach our professional soldiers and officers the Swedish language so that they may effectively communicate."
 fubuki.45.a: "This reform is needed"
 fubuki.45.b: "Who sent this cash? Finders' keepers!"

 fubuki.46.t: "Final Integration Efforts"
 fubuki.46.desc: "Word has come from our far flung Russian territories that the targets set by our regime for integration are slowly being met. Although news has been slow to reach us, there is a clear lack of activity on the ground. No news is good news right?"
 fubuki.46.a: "Surely it must be"

 fubuki.47.t: "Russian Territorial Brigades Cause Trouble"
 fubuki.47.desc: "After hearing news of our nation's integration efforts, discipline and moral amongst soldiers in the Territorial Brigades has plummeted.

 fubuki.47.a: "Their use has come to an end"
 fubuki.47.b: "We must persevere"

 fubuki.48.t: "Results of Integrating the Oblasts"

 fubuki.50.desc: "After a period of ruling our Russian territories, we can safely say that the Kronii Oblast has been..."
 fubuki.50.a: "a massive success!"
 fubuki.50.b: "a serious flop!"

 fubuki.51.t: "The WFA Coup"
 fubuki.51.desc: "Our trust in the WFA has been misplaced! Today the WFA has marched into Stockholm and seized key buildings. They have proclaimed the start of a new era of Scandinavian nationalism under a military government."
 fubuki.51.a: "Uh oh"

 fubuki.52.t: "The Trial of Hugo Osterman"
 fubuki.52.desc: "One of our top field marshals, Hugo Osterman is a smart and competent officer. However, his rise to prominence and his influence over the Royal Army is of concern, especially due to his political motives and ambitions remaining unknown."
 fubuki.52.a: "The bigger they are the harder they fall"
 fubuki.52.b: "Spare him"

 fubuki.53.t: "The Trial of Axel Bredberg"
 fubuki.53.desc: "While he is a decorated commander and one of our most cunning tacticians, Axel Bredberg's loyalties are still up for debate. He had previously served as a captain in the Swedish army and there are some rumours of him remaining loyal to the old Swedish King."
 fubuki.53.a: "Your disloyalty will be paid with your blood"
 fubuki.53.b: "Spare him"

 fubuki.54.t: "The Trial of Karl Wilkama"
 fubuki.54.desc: "A veteran of the Finnish Civil War alongside Mannerheim, Karl Fredrik Wilkama has served Fubuki since she led Finland to independence. But as time goes on, some are concerned that the old general has gained much influence within the army, second only to Mannerheim himself."
 fubuki.55.a: "He is too dangerous to be left alive"
 fubuki.54.b: "Spare him"

 fubuki.55.t: "The Trial of Axel Airo"
 fubuki.55.desc: "Aksel Airo made a name for himself, having developed new artillery tactics on the battlefield due to his experience during the Civil War. However despite his promise, some are sceptical of Airo's political leanings, due to his past as an ardent supporter of Finnish independence. The fact that his father had changed their family name from the Swedish Johansson to the Finnish Airo does not help his case."
 fubuki.55.a: "He simply can't be trusted"
 fubuki.55.b: "Spare him"

 fubuki.56.t: "The Trial of Curt Goransson"
 fubuki.56.desc: "One of the youngest generals in our army, Goransson shows great promise in his rise through the ranks. However, more conservative minded officers have shown suspicion at the young officer, thinking that his rise to prominence has been too quick for an infantry commander."
 fubuki.56.a: "Youth is also rash"
 fubuki.56.b: "Spare him"

 fubuki.58.t: "The Trial of Mannerheim"
 fubuki.58.desc: "Carl Gustaf Mannerheim is a legendary Field Marshal and for good reason. Leading the Finnish Whites to victory alongside Fubuki during the Civil War, later on leading the further conquests of Scandinavia, paving the way for our empire's foundation. But his close relationship to Fubuki, along with his massive control over the armed forces is cause for alarm, with some fearful over his popularity and control."
 fubuki.58.a: "Sorry old friend, it's nothing personal"
 fubuki.58.b: "Spare him"

 fubuki.57.t: "Result of the Purges"
 fubuki.57.desc: "Having combed through the high echelons of the military, we believe that the upper leadership is now secure. The results of our various investigations, trials and purges should be showing themselves soon."
 fubuki.57.a: "We really showed them didn't we!"
 fubuki.57.b: "I think we could have done much more..."
 fubuki.57.b: "What did this accomplish again!?"

 fubuki.59.t: "The WFA Revolution"
 fubuki.59.desc: "In a shock turn of events, top leadership of the WFA Sweden has cut communication and began to organize an uprising against our government. We must quell this quickly!"
 fubuki.59.a: "Onwards!"

 fubuki.60.t: "Expansion of the CNSI"
 fubuki.60.desc: "The CNSI, our country's intelligence agency, needs to be improved if it is to remain competetive with other spy agencies around the world. The head of the CNSI has proposed two expansion plans. One which focuses on the gathering of military intelligence and the other that focuses on anti-partisan activities."
 fubuki.60.a: "Information wins wars"
 fubuki.60.b: "Our efforts are best placed fighting resistance"

 fubuki.61.t: "Fubuki Jeered in the Streets"
 fubuki.61.desc: "While passing through a less well off neighbourhood in Stockholm, passerbys began to jeer at Fubuki. Despite this negative feedback though, it is still an improvement from previous attempts at public appearances."
 fubuki.61.a: "We still clearly have some work to do"

 fubuki.62.t: "Fubuki Meets a Veteran"
 fubuki.62.desc: "Today while on campaign, Queen Fubuki has encountered a former soldier of hers who fought as a part of the White Fox Army in its infancy. The veteran under her command had fought in the Finnish Civil War, the LHS Expeditionary Wars in Russia, the Narvik Campaign and finally the Danish Campaign before finally being discharged.\n\nTalking with the veteran reminded Fubuki of her days as a military commander under the Russian Empire and then as Marshal of the Scandinavian Commonwealth. It made her almost nostalgic of the battlefield. Contemplating the many praises she received, the veteran finally asked whether or not she would ever lead her troops into battle again."
 fubuki.62.a: "'Yes, I yearn to be a leader once again!'"
 fubuki.62.b: "'No, my place is with the people on the home front...'"

 fubuki.63.t: "Parliament Walks Out"
 fubuki.63.desc: "Fed up of Fubuki and the demissionary government's lack of action to democratize, the opposition Social Democrats marched out of parliament with no desire to return to office. Opposition Leader Kyosti Kallio before leaving made a speech decrying the government's failures and broken promises. Seeing the writing on the wall, other parties including Gosta Bagge's Conservatives followed suite and left parliament.\n\nWith practically no parliament seats being filled, our government has  reverted to a royal dictatorship. Protests have already erupted in rural and urban areas alike and reports from overseas indicate that political exiles under former King Gustav V are gathering in Amsterdam to attempt an overthrowal of the monarchy."
 fubuki.63.a: "Damn it!"

 fubuki.64.t: "King Gustav V Returns!"
 fubuki.64.desc: "The ports at Malmo were packed as men from all across the country came to witness the arrival of King Gustav V and a group of other political exiles. Whereas only weeks before they would have been arrested on the spot, so fed up of Fubuki's regime was the populace that soldiers and officials alike let the former King and his entourage begin their march to Stockholm; even allowing them to take horses and weapons from the local barracks.\n\nIf King Gustav is allowed to march into the capital, it is certain that the regime will be toppled!"
 fubuki.64.a: "...they let him go?"

 fubuki.65.t: "Gustav's Coup!"
 fubuki.65.desc: "The former King Gustav V alongside crowds of supporters and political exiles have marched into Stockholm unapposed. Under his order, supporters and mutineers alike stormed the Rikstag. As our ministers fled the capital, King Gustav marched in and declared that the illegitimate government under Fubuki was over and that he was to be restored King. Our Great Leader Fubuki chose to remain in her palace during the last moments of her reign. When an angry mob stormed the palace, they found their Queen slumped over at her study; clearly intoxicated. Never before had they seen her so fragile. From then on she could no longer be Queen."
 fubuki.65.a: "Long Live Gustav V!"

 fubuki.66.t: "Gustav's March Scatters!"
 fubuki.66.desc: "The threat posed by the former King Gustav V has dissipated! Upon his entourage's arrival to the outskirts of Stockholm, they were encountered by our brave armed forces who refused them entry. After a brief scuffle, most people scattered from the scene after it became clear that this attempted putsch was to fail. The former King and other important exiles have been placed under arrest.\n\nThis has been a remarkable success given the massive threat he posed when he landed!"
 fubuki.66.a: "Here's to another 50 years as Queen!"

 fubuki.67.t: "Parliament Satisfied with the Reforms"
 fubuki.67.desc: "Head of the Opposition, Kyosti Kallio, has released a statement congratulating the Demissionary Government for its widereaching and more than satisfactory democratic reforms. Fubuki's regime has greatly thawed out in recent months. This statement simply shows the reality of the situation. No longer is Scandinavia under a royal dictatorship, but a functional democracy representative of the people!"
 fubuki.67.a: "Here's to a brighter future!"

 fubuki.68.t: "The Social Democrats Declare Victory"
 fubuki.68.desc: "To nobody's surpise, the Social Democrats led by Kyosti Kallio has come out on top in our recent election; easily crushing Gosta Bagge's Conservatives. The Social Democrats for weeks have dominated the polls and their victory only solidifies their position as our country's most popular party. The other parties have accepted Kyosti Kallio's victory although there were some grumbles amongst the Communist and Nationalist parties who greatly underperformed. Nevertheless it seems that the Social Democrats will be in charge for the next four years. "
 fubuki.68.a: "An expected, but welcomed victory"

 fubuki.69.t: "The Conservative Party Declares Victory"
 fubuki.69.desc: "To everyone's surprise, Gosta Bagge and his Conservative Party has won a majority of seats in the Rikstag. This result comes after weeks of poor polling in comparison to the seemingly unstoppable Social Democrats. The other parties have accepted Gosta Bagge's shock victory although some remain skepticle of the results. Nevertheless it seems that the Conservatives will be in charge for the next four years."
 fubuki.69.a: "Here's to four years of moderate rule!"

 fubuki.70.t: "The Two Parties Tie!"
 fubuki.70.desc: "Today the results of our election have come in. According to our First Past the Post system, the party who receives the most seats is to become the ruling party. This did not happen though. Instead, the Social Democrats and Conservatives tied in the polls with the former winning the popular vote by a significant margin.\n\nAlthough Fubuki has lost significant power during the democratization process, one of the most important royal powers remaining is the ability to select the ruling party if a tie was to occur. Seeing as this materialized, it is up to our Queen to decide who will lead the country for the next four years."
 fubuki.70.a: "The Conservatives are the more responsable bunch"
 fubuki.70.b: "The Social Democrats won fair and square"

 fubuki.71.t: "Election Decried as Fraudulent"
 fubuki.71.desc: "The Social Democrats have boycotted the election results and have released a shocking damnation against the ruling government for blatantly meddling in the election. The Conservative party has followed suit and has refused to accept the election results.\n\nWith practically no parliament seats being filled, our government has reverted to a royal dictatorship. Protests have already erupted in rural and urban areas alike and reports from overseas indicate that political exiles under former King Gustav V are gathering in Amsterdam to attempt an overthrowal of the monarchy."
 fubuki.71.a: "Uh oh"

 fubuki.72.t: "Kiara Demands Schleswig-Holstein"
 fubuki.72.desc: "Kiara has demanded that our rightful territory of Schleswig-Holstein be surrendered to her at once."
 fubuki.72.a: "Here you go"
 fubuki.72.b: "For free? Never!"
