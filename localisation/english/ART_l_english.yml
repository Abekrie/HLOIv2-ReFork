ART_artia: "Artia"
ART_artia_desc: "Artia is the nationalistic, pro-Han Chinese governor of Yunnan province. Her sino-centric policies have drawn heavy criticism from both fellow Hololive China council members and the pro-LHS Gura central government. Nevertheless she maintains her Chinese supremacist provincial policy.\n\nAria was part of the original Hololive China branch council members who governed over the entirety of China, serving as the head secretary of the council and administered both the central government in Beijing and the Southwest of China. She came to a head with Artia over her pro-Han policies that resulted in the collapse of the Hololive China council. Artia retreated to Yunnan and wasn't greatly affected by the Japanese invasion and after the war continued her rule of Yunnan after defeating Long Yun.\n\nCurrently, Artia is the most adamant anti-Gura force in China aside from the CPG. She pro-Sinic rhetoric paints Gura as a non-Chinese invader and she seeks to rid her from China. She is biding her time and building her forces to re-unify China and expel all non-Chinese."
