 GNW_NOE_apply_lessons_desc: "The Great Northern War proved to be a great testing ground for new theories and tactics in warfare. Applying what we had learned during the war will make us the most capable fighting force, able to match the seemingly endless manpower of the Scandinavian Empire."

 GNW_NOE_ideological_zeal_desc: "Over one hundred and eighty years ago, the heroic king Friedrich Der Grosse and his mighty army held back the forces of France, Austria, Sweden and Russia.

 GNW_NOE_mass_production: "Mass Production"
 GNW_NOE_mass_production_desc: "The key to victory is to outproduce Fubuki's industry. If we maximise our production, we will have an endless amount of war materiel."

 GNW_NOE_purchase_naval_bombers: "Purchase Naval Bombers"
 GNW_NOE_purchase_naval_bombers_desc: "Just like on land, air power is the new deciding factor of war on the seas. Through the purchasing of foreign naval bombers, we will not only fill in any production deficits, but learn from these foreign models and what can be used for our own designs."

 GNW_NOE_purchase_new_dive_bombers_desc: "A concept dating back to the great war, the ability to accurately strike enemy targets on the battlefield is a tactic that is vital in modern warfare.

 GNW_NOE_penal_units_desc: "In dire times such as these, we must make use of every person to contribute to the fight. Even the most undesirable of people such as the criminals rotting in our prisons can be made useful, building defences and earthworks."
 GNW_NOE_tank_breakthrough: "Tank Breakthroughs"
 GNW_NOE_tank_breakthrough_desc: "While the tank has existed since the Great War, not many have thought how to best use it. Using the latest in armour designs, our theorists have devised that the best way to use tanks is to punch a hole through enemy lines, then outmanoeuvre their troops."
 GNW_NOE_artillery_support: "Artillery Support"
 GNW_NOE_artillery_support_desc: "Like the Prussian army in 1870, the key to victory is through superior artillery tactics. Coordinated strikes and quick infantry movement to exploit the opening will guarantee a quick victory."
