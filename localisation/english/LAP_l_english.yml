LAP_laplus_darkness: "Laplus Darkness"
LAP_laplus_darkness_desc: "Laplus Darkness is the dictatorial head of Peru and one of the pro-LHS regional powers of South America. Lapus also is the leader of the HoloX secret society seeking global domination. She is one of the states that are part of the LHS containment strategy of the Resistance revolution and Laplus plays along to this role. However, she has a long term strategic secret agenda of world domination through utilizing LHS resources and undermining their rule worldwide through HoloX.\n\nPost-Brugg, Laplus was one of the nations granted a territory in the governance of South America. Utilizing her position, Laplus over the years has built up a sizeable and professional military force in the region and maintained HoloX society contacts around the globe to build up her plans for global dominance. Her plans for HoloX bleeds out a sizeable portion of LHS funding in South America under the guise of “Resistance containment”, but in reality puts funding towards HoloX.\n\nLaplus has one of the most well trained and well equipped militaries in the region that guards the border against Aqua's Resistance. She must put her funds towards boosting HoloX members around the globe while not giving notice to the LHS, who have been more investigative recently.Though Aqua is a genuine threat to her existence, she could potentially play off the Resistance and make a deal with them to further HoloX's goals."
