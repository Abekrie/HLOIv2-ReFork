IRU_irys: "Irys"
IRU_irys_desc: "Irys is the prime minister of the area of former Liberia and Governor General of LHS West Africa. Her devotion to conservative Yagooism and LHS authority allows her to maintain consistent funding from the LHS and Irys' “policy of Hope brings about genuine adoration from the people she rules.\n\nIrys operates her nation under the guiding principles of democratic, conservative Yagooism; she believes in pure, seiso ideology and governance of idols. Unlike the corrupt post-Brugg African warlords or colonial remnants under Hololive control, Irys holds a genuine belief in spreading the good word of the LHS and operates under a “Hope for all” policy. In her policy of Hope she seeks to create a high value, industrialized society for the people under her rule and eventually spread Hope across Africa. Irys believes in the good will of humanity and seeks to uplift Africa from abject poverty.\n\nIrys plans to acquire more permissions from LHS global administration to push forward her Project Hope. However, despite her nation's rapid industrialization, high living standards and potential for growth, Project Hope is currently hampered by incompetent LHS bureaucracy. Irys must make the decision to trust in the Yagooist process or work outside the means of orthodox Yagooism to spread Hope across Africa."

irys.1.t: "Fubuki Offers Us Ghana"
irys.1.d: "In an unexpected twist of fate, an opportunity presents itself for us to take direct control of Fubuki's colony of Ghana. Whatever the reason for this sudden proposition, with an almost token contribution to their nation as payment, we could easily expand our regional control with little to no effort needed!"
irys.1.a: "Sure!"
irys.1.b: "We don't want it"
