capital_events.27.d:0 ""As I walk the streets of Berlin, I find myself amongst rubble of an empire destined for greatness. The hopes and dreams for the German people, the master race, gone, wasted, and finished. The Fatherland has never had a fair shot on the world stage of power! The true potential of Germany has yet been uncovered by our enemies. The ones who call themselves “Hololivers” took away our spotlight! It is all their fault! They messed everything up, and now not only do we suffer, but our families too! The world will realize the intentions of these animated brats, and put them back in their place, wherever they belong. Being the natural master race, We will push through these hard times Like so many other times before! Though the future of a Great Germany is gone, we rest in wait for someone new to lead us. To reignite the passion of war in us again, and take back what is rightfully ours!"\n - A Patriotic Citizen of the Reich"
