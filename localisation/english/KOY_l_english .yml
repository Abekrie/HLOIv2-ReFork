KOY_hakui_koyori: "Hakui Koyori"
KOY_hakui_koyori_desc: "Hakui Koyori is one of the head Asacoco production scientists aligned with Kiryu Coco, based out of Arizona and New Mexico. She produces some of the most pure and high quality Asacoco in the world and is under a contract by Coco to produce this product. Though Koyori prides herself as a scientist and producer of Asacoco, her true allegiance lies with Laplus and HoloX, the secret society that wishes to rule the world.\n\nKoyori arrived in North America under the orders of Laplus to soften up the continent for conquest. While Laplus handled gaining trust with the LHS and took their resources, Koyori was to gain an understanding of the Coco Resistance's inner workings to eventually uproot it from within. Utilizing her scientific intellect, Koyori presented Coco with a superior variant of Asacoco, gaining a production contract with Coco in exchange for protection and observer status of the Coco Resistance. She cooks up Asacoco for several years, working her way into Coco's trust and gaining an understanding of the Resistance to relay the info to Coco.\n\nAt the moment, Koyori continues to cook for Coco and relay information to Laplus. With tensions in Mio's America and Coco's America brewing, Koyori can take the opportunity to play off several key figures or perhaps just take out Coco from behind in the name of HoloX."
