RIS_ayunda_risu: "Ayunda Risu"
RIS_ayunda_risu_desc: "Ayunda Risu is the ironfisted governor of Java with strong Resistance leanings. She is one of the primary direct opponents of the Moona administration, poised to reunite Indonesia under her own nutty image.\n\nRisu originally was a student in the Dutch education system in Indonesia and took part in Indonesia nationalist activities pre-Great War. She used her nationalist groups to overthrow the colonial government during the Hololive Revolution. She was an early signer of the 1st Hololive Indonesia Republic that faltered due to a lack of LHS support so she leaned towards Aqua and Coco for support. By the time the 2nd Hololive Indonesia Republic formed, Risu had a firm position in Indonesian politics and was narrowly beaten by Moona in the first election. The country began fragmenting due to the result and Risu gathered her supporters to her base in Java.\n\nRisu seeks to defeat the other factions of the civil war in Indonesia to build a new Indonesian republic. Although she leans towards the Resistance, she needs to make a decision on whether to support the revolutionary Aqua or nationalist Coco"
