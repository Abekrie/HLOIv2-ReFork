BAE_hakos_baelz: "Hakos Baelz"
BAE_hakos_baelz_desc: "	Hakos Baelz is the president of Colombia, more colloquially known as the Republic of Baelz. She is a pro-LHS, seiso ruler in the region who takes many cues from Subaru and serves as a part of the LHS's containment strategy of Aqua in South America. She is one of the youngest yet clueless rulers of the LHS and her lack of understanding of “modern technology” (by 1936 standards) irks many of her people.\n\nBaelz originally started out as an agent for the US government, performing missions in South America to push American national and corporate interests. Through her charisma and American dollars, she gains political power and a strong following in Colombia and takes over the country in a coup in the wake of the Hololive Revolution. Upon taking power she takes many cues from LHS Seiso policy and becomes one of the forces against Aqua's Resistance expansionism in the region. In the 1930s, the Panama Canal Incident kicked off when Marine invaded Panama when it fell into instability and Baelz attempted to counter-invade to keep peace in the region. Marine appealed the the LHS that she was merely securing assets from Resistance takeover and that Baelz was interfering with the process. Baelz got sanctions for a few months by the LHS and lost prestige.\n\nCurrently Baelz must balance power between Colombia's liberals and conservatives as the strongman of Colombia. In addition, she must contend with Aqua's Resistance infiltration in the region and has to make up for her embarrassment at Panama."

 baelz.1.t: "[FROM.GetName] Returned the Panama Canal"
 baelz.1.d: "A black stain on our past was the moment we acquiesced our control of the Panama Canal without a real fight. Our justified demands for the immediate handover of the continental crossing have been successful and we can finally put that behind us and move forward once more. Truly a red letter day."
 baelz.1.a: "Success! Score one for Team Rat... What's a canal?"

 baelz.2.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused to Return the Panama Canal"
 baelz.2.d: "Disaster! Despite our justified claims on the continental crossing, [FROM.GetName] have somehow come to the conclusion that they should still continue to hold the territory despite their unjust claim to the area. This would mark a second humiliation in the same decade! The real question is how we proceed from here."
 baelz.2.a: "Well this won't do will it? Sergio, call up the boys, it's time for a spot of re-negotiation."
 baelz.2.b: "The what now?"

 baelz.3.t: "The Liberal Coup"
 baelz.3.d: "Nationalism must fall! Liberal supporters storm the Capitolio Nacional and proclaim the coming formation of a new, democratic government. Whilst the initial perpetrators are arrested, before long the uprising truly starts and gunfire is heard across the nation. Blood will spill for the idea of Ratism but who’s blood is the real question."
 baelz.3.a: "For a Second Liberal Republic!"
 baelz.3.b: "La Rata o Muerte!"

 baelz.4.t: "The Conservative Coup"
 baelz.4.d: "An end to Nationalism! Democratic hardliners storm the Capitolio Nacional and proclaim the coming formation of a new, Conservative government! Spurred on by their proclamation, supporters take to the streets, assaulting police and agents of the government indiscriminately. The bloodshed is just beginning…"
 baelz.4.a: "Ratism wasn't working"
 baelz.4.b: "La Rata o Muerte!"

 baelz.5.t: "A Populist Ratism"
 baelz.5.d: "'A chain is only as strong as its weakest point, adding more links will just make it weaker. A nation is only as strong as its people!' Despite her struggles using what she considers 'newfangled' radio broadcasting, Baelz' message was crystal clear, the split in politics will only lead to struggle in the future if allowed to continue down its path of division and factional tribalism."
 baelz.5.a: "The people united will never be defeated!"

 baelz.6.t: "A Militaristic Ratism"
 baelz.6.d:  "In a smoky closed off boardroom surrounded by her top brass, Baelz lays out her plan for a complete military reorganisation. With the topics of infiltration by Aqua's agents, the abjectly disgraceful state of the standing Army, Air Force funding and the goal of a true Green Water Navy. The army is to be re-examined but what she requires from her command is loyalty. Baelz makes it crystal clear that insubordination at this critical phase would lead to disastrous consequences."
 baelz.6.a: "Compadres, we must stand together"

 baelz.7.t: "An Intellectual Ratism"
 baelz.7.d: "During a recent university tour, an unplanned and unexpected question pops up during a speech. “Why not democracy?” a young student asks. After a moment of stunned silence in the room, Baelz shocks the audience with a very nuanced take on Unitary government. No stranger to covert tactics and undermining governments with her background, Baelz is incredibly candid at laying out the tactics she has seen being utilised by foreign and domestic “threats”. Nary a pin drop could be heard in the auditorium after her speech, no doubt many a young mind would have to rethink their entire philosophy from this remarkable encounter."
 baelz.7.a: "Democracy is decadent indeed"

 baelz.8.t: "El Estado Ratismo"
 baelz.8.d: "Given her best efforts, Baelz has walked a tightrope act for the last year. Whispers of coups, the demands of Conservatives and Liberals alike as well as the support of the military, the intelligentsia and the very populace itself hangs in the balance. Has she done enough to convince those who would stand against her? Or has her trademark Ratismo only gotten her so far? There can only be one outcome…"
 baelz.8.a: "For a Brighter Future"
 baelz.8.b: "We will crush them"
 baelz.8.c: "Uh oh"

 baelz.9.t: "The Ratist Coup"
 baelz.9.d: "Tied up in internal conflict and its own bureaucracy, the democratic supporters fail to make any meaningful impact on the populace and their hardliner attempts to storm the Capitolio Nacional faltered at the front door. Calls for an uprising are met with apathy and the supporters are rounded up and arrested. One thing is clear, the people have put their faith in Baelz and her take on Nationalism to guide them into the future. A true Ratismo if there ever was one by every standard!"
 baelz.9.a: "Viva la Rata!"
