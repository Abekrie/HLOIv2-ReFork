LAM_yukihana_lamy: "Yukihana Lamy"
LAM_yukihana_lamy_desc: "The so-called 'Queen of the Cossacks', Lamy is the ruler of the Caucasus region. Though a well respected and benevolent ruler, Lamy is plagued by the stress of maintaining the tension between political factions and ethnic groups. As a result, she often consumes alcohol to soothe her nerves, but if she consumes too much she will be rendered unable to effectively run her kingdom.\n\nOriginally the daughter of a noble family, Lamy would join Hololive before being one of many sent back in time to the 20th Century. Winding up in Imperial Russia, Lamy would use experiences from her past life to pose as part of the Russian nobility. When the Great War erupted, she disguised herself as a man in order to join the Russian Imperial Army, joining a Cossack Cavalry regiment. During her time in Russia, Lamy's already present alcoholism would worsen as she developed a love for strong Russian Vodka. When Russia descended into revolution, Lamy would follow Rushia's example and led White forces to war against the Bolsheviks in the Caucuses and Southern Russia. With White Army commanders such as Lavr Kornilov, Pyotr Krasnov and Mikhail Drozdovsky Lamy would drive out the Reds from the Caucuses, before she was given control over the region during the Treaty of Brugg.\n\nLamy's kingdom is now inhabited by Russians not affiliated with Rushia's kingdom, or those who have fled from Fubuki and the RSR. Between herself, Lamy must contend and balance out three major factions. The Loyalists who advocate for her to maintain her power, the White Army under Kornilov that wish for a militarized state, and the Reformers, who wish that ethnic minorities such as Georgians, Armenians, and others are given better representation. However this is but a thorn in Lamy's side as she looks beyond the Caucuses towards her true goal, the subjugation and unification of all Russian lands under her reign"
