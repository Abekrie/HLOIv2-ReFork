KRN_inugami_korone: "Inugami Korone"
KRN_inugami_korone_desc: "Inugami Korone is the successor to the Ottoman Empire and co-hegemon of the Middle East, controlling Turkey and a majority of Arabia. Korone's modernist outlook helped push the Middle East and Turkey from being backward nations pre-Great War to a fledgling modernist state approaching mass industrialization. Her wildcard personality tends to keep her outward enemies on their toes and her internal opponents second guessing themselves.\n\nKorone was one of the leaders of the Arab Revolt during the Great War and one of the heads of the Arabian theater of the Hololive Revolution, with the other head being Okayu. Korone allied herself with pan-Arabists and liberal minded Turks to overthrow the Ottomans and other existing Arab monarchs to establish a new order by the Hololive Revolution. Post-Brugg, Korone and Okayu maintained strong ties and cooperation to develop the Middle East, expanding resource extraction and infrastructure. Her hands off approach to governance has allowed for many pre-war Arab monarchs to keep their lands and titles that allow for easier governance of her vast territory while modernizing.\n\nKorone's greatest threat lies not beyond her borders but from within; traditionalist elements of Arab and Turkish society aren't appreciative of Korone's modernization and wish to expel her as an infidel from their lands. The decentralized nature of Korone's governance is beginning to be a problem due as the local monarchs are starting to demand independence and are siding with traditionalist elements. Korone needs to balance her internal politics before she can even think about tackling any external threats to her or the LHS."
