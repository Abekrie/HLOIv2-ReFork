NIN_inanis_ninomae: "Ninomae Ina'nis"
NIN_inanis_ninomae_desc: "Ninomae Ina'nis or simply Ina is the founder and leader of The Tentacult, the mysterious and occultist religious group in the East Asia. She heeded Yagoo's call to arms in the global Hololive Revolution. She worked together with her fellow Genmate Gawr Gura to push the Japanese out of China and end their rule over Korea. Her cute demeanor and artistic mind allowed her to be a charming and caring leader of The Tentacult, a large new age religious sect that currently controls Korea and Manchuria. Ina's goal is world domination, but it is without malice; she merely wishes to create a new existence for mankind and bring about a new age of peace.\n\nThough she was originally a humble artist traveling the world, her travels revealed plenty of human hardship and suffering that eventually pushed her to make a change. Through what she called “The Ancient Ones”, Ina developed a religious doctrine that will change the world and formed The Tentacult, a new age religion that seeks to elevate mankind and eliminate human suffering. It is only through World domINAtion by The Tentacult that mankind will transcend and be united as one.\n\nAside from being a great spiritual leader for Takodachi, she is seen as the face of Korean nationalism in her core territories in Korea. The Tentacult and its religious teachings became popular in Japanese controlled Korea and infiltrated a majority of the Korean arm of the Imperial Japanese Army and government in Korea. When the Tentacult uprising started, a large number of the Japanese IJA joined the Tentacult and overthrew the Japanese government, which helped follow a general Korean nationalist rebellion. The liberation of Korea by the Tentacultist uprising became synonymous with the Korean independence movement, and in turn Ina became Korea's national symbol. Despite The Tentacult's majority Korean leadership, there is a sizable portion of Chinese in The Tentacult who range from ordinary citizens living in Manchuria to former Fengtian Clique members. The Tentacult also maintains many small missions around the world to spread the good word of Ina and the Tentacult; afterall, Ina's ambition knows no boundaries."
