ECH_spade_echo: "Spade Echo"
ECH_spade_echo_desc: "Echo is the feared Triad Dragonhead in Fujian province. Effectively, Fujian province is merely a Triad hideout that happens to be a state as various criminal activities flow freely through the province. Echo helps facilitate and empower Triads around China as the Dragonhead of the region.\n\nEcho originally arrived at Ningo before the Hololive Revolution and worked in San Francisco as a hitman before returning to China to continue Triad work there. After the Hololive Revolution, she was one of the members of the original Hololive China branch council members who governed over the entirety of China. When the council collapsed into civil war, she mostly stuck to internal Triad politics rather than engaging the other CNs. When the Japanese invaded and Gura arrived to fix the China situation, Echo was reluctant at first but eventually helped Gura kick out the Japanese through her Triad contacts.\n\nEcho still remains as Dragonhead and is focused on making money through illicit means, but does have ambitions to unite China under her rule. She would be ok with uniting against Gura should all the other Hololive China members agree to a mutual alliance and currently heads the legalized “Leftist National Republican Party of China” as a legal political entity."
