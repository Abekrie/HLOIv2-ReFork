aloe.1.t:0 "Proposition from Suisei"
aloe.1.d:0 "This morning a transmission arrived in Budapest from France, containing a simple proposition from Suisei. It appears that she has offered us the choice of bending the knee before her power over Europe, wishing for us to be brought under her fold peacefully, without bloodshed. She demands that French troops and authority be given jurisdiction over our lands, so that they may enforce French will. One thing is clear, however, even if we are to refuse, Suisei will not simply take no for an answer."
aloe.1.a:0 "This is the best choice."
aloe.1.b:0 "We shall govern ourselves."

aloe.2.t:0 "Results of the Yagoo Conference."
aloe.2.d:0 "The LHS, at the behest of Yagoo, has convened a great meeting in Belgrade over the past weeks. The LHS discussed the best course of action for the compounding problems facing the LHS and Yagooslavia. We were scarcely able to influence the course of the conference, as it primarily came down to Yagoo and his most trusted or powerful states discussing their future approach to world affairs. There were three main outlooks debated at this conference. \n \n The first was internationalism, which is the traditional LHS approach. These conservative thinker advocated for upholding the LHS status-quo. They would support Hololivism, and especially Yagooism, around the world. They would build their influence in these regions, blocking Resistance or Anti ideas from cultivating their growth. The people of those regions, for all intents and purposes, still governed themselves, but they would be obliged to follow LHS rules and protocols. This is the expected decision from the conference, but it does us little favors. We should mainly expect the LHS meddling in our affairs if this is to be result of the conference. \n \n The second set of ideals advocated is called Regionalism. It primarily revolves around letting each region handle its matters on the whole, but wherever LHS allies and interests lay they would still influence and build ties as necessary. It largely advocates a more hands off global force, except for whenever it's in their direct backyard or associated with close allies of Yagoo. This is our preferred outcome, as it would allow us to handle our affairs as we see fit, but should matters complicate or we found ourselves in trouble we could always call upon Yagoo and the LHS to assist us. \n \n The final, minority mindset is Yagooslav nationalism. This is the worst situation we can imagine, if this is the outlook determined at the Yagoo conference. The Yagooslav nationalists wish to see Yagooslav focus all the power of the LHS inside Yagooslavia, so as to build their direct power. From there, they wish to exert their control over their neighbors and then influence the rest of the world as a sole major power. This is especially worrying due to our close proximity to Yagooslavia, leaving us a prime target for the Yagooslav nationalists. We must hope this is not the result of the Yagooslav conference."
aloe.2.a:0 "That was not ideal."
aloe.2.b:0 "Splendid!"
aloe.2.c:0 "Damn, the situation has changed!"

aloe.3.t:0 "Anti Revolution in Hungary!" 
aloe.3.d:0 "Anti Protests across Hungary have reached their peak, the nation has fallen into civil war. Anti protestors in Debrecen raged across the city throughout the day, but at night the rioters did not disperse. They seized control of the city hall, declaring their intent to bring down Aloe and the pro-LHS regime in Hungary. The rebels, calling themselves the 'Hungarian National Government' have found little support or recognition in the wider world. The local police sided with the rebels, forcing the military garrison to withdraw from the city. The city mayor, being pro-Aloe, was executed in the city center alongside his government. \n \n Aloe has sworn that she shall avenge the mayor and crush the rebels, without quarter. Most in the Hungarian government have pledged their support to Aloe, condemning the revolutionaries. In response to the outbreak of war, many Aloe generals have sided with Aloe in this conflict, however a certain few, as well as several army formations and units, have broken contact, citing that their support for the Anti cause. The LHS has condemned the rebels, but have taken no action and no meaningful support has arrived for Aloes' cause, causing some to question their usefulness to Hungary. Several who support Aloe have even suggested leaving the LHS, due to their failure to support Aloe's government. \n \n The Antis pledge that they are fighting for the Hungarian people as well as all the people of the world. Their new National Government has promised that Hungary shall become a haven and sanctuary from LHS ideals. While extremely few foreign governments officially support them, they have the extensive approval of the Anti movements in all parts of the world. The government of Japan has officially recognized the National Government, however they have not promised any support or volunteers. The Antis have decreed that every man shall fight to the end, to form a bastion against Holovism in Europe. \n \n Now begins the Civil war in Hungary, Aloe seeking to put down the revolution and opposition which has overtaken her country and beloved ideals, while the Antis seek to take back their home from what they see as foreign and power-hungry tyrants. Now the world watches, as the treaty of Brugg tears at the seams in Hungary."
aloe.3.a:0 "Down with Aloe! For Hungary!"
aloe.3.b:0 "We must put down this threat!"
aloe.3.c:0 "The LHS has clearly abandoned us"

aloe.4.t:0 "Transylvania Seized!"
aloe.4.d:0 "While we were distracted by our own modern, fighting a fierce struggle for our own survival and security, Mel has betrayed and attacked us. Troops following Mels orders marched across the border, seizing Transylvania. They claim that they are only safeguarding the territory for us, so that they may keep it safe from rebels and antis. They are clearly traitorous and scheming in their plan, simply preying upon us while we are down!"
aloe.4.a:0 "Damn."

aloe.5.t:0 "Unvar Seized!"
aloe.5.d:0 "Czechoslovakia has marched their troops across our border once more, seizing the territory of Unvar. They claims that they are acting in the interests of peace, so that they may protect their territories and peoples within. They are clearly opportunistic, attacking us while we are weak."
aloe.5.a:0 "Damn." 

aloe.6.t:0 "Unvar Returned!"
aloe.6.d:0 "After our requests and difficulties, we have made a breakthrough in our diplomacy. The Czech government has conceded, and in interests of community and friendship, will return the territory of Unvar to our people. The transfer is set to take place without delay, in a small ceremony. \n \n Some claim this is not enough, though, with many jingoistic and aggressive members of governments calling for Slovakia to also fall under our control. This may ruin the opportunity to build relations with the Czech government, though, for a demand like this may come down to force. The decision comes down to Aloe in the end."
aloe.6.a:0 "We stand triumphant."
aloe.6.b:0 "Unvar is not enough!"

aloe.7.t:0 "Translyvania Returned!"
aloe.7.d:0 "After weeks of diplomatic demands and threats, Mels troops have finally withdrawn from Transylvania. They cite that their peacekeeping mission is over, and that the people of Transylvania are no longer granted protection by Mel. Mel has formally invited Aloe to return her authority to the region. The people of Hungary celebrate, for our long lost brothers and kin in Transylvania are now returned to Hungary!"
aloe.7.a:0 "Tranyslvania shall remain with us."

aloe.8.t:0 "The Czechs Refuse Our Demands!"
aloe.8.d:0 "We have sent a list of demands to the Czech government, insisting that the Czech return Unvar to us at once, for that territory is rightfully ours. The Czech government has refused, saying that they shall protect the citizens of Unvar from us. Such nonsense cannot be tolerated. We shall liberate our kin and brethren who wrongfully forced to live under the Czech yoke. However to push this issue any further would result in a war, as the conflict would quickly spiral out of our control. Let us be sure we are ready for the burden of a war."
aloe.8.a:0 "Now is not the time to press the issue."
aloe.8.b:0 "We shall not accept this!"

aloe.9.t:0 "Mel Refuses Our Demands!"
aloe.9.d:0 "We have long pressed for Transylvania to be returned to Hungary, so that we may restore the Hungarian people to Hungary. However Mel has repeatedly ignored our requests, declaring that the people of Transylvania are rightfully under her protection. She has declared that Hungary has no legal claim or rights to Transylvania. It does not appear as though she will back down on this issue, which leaves us with a predicament. We must either fight for our people, or resign to settle this conflict another day."
aloe.9.a:0 "We are not able to fight Mel now."
aloe.9.b:0 "To arms! We must go to war !"

aloe.10.t:0 "Slovakia Refuses Our Demands!"
aloe.10.d:0 "Despite our rightful claims on Southern Slovakia and our insistent demands for our territory and people to be returned to us, Mel has refused to return the territory to us. They have turned away our diplomats empty handed and claim Southern Slovakia is theirs. If we are to press our claims now we could find ourselves in a war, let us be sure we are ready for such a conflict."
aloe.10.a:0 "Patience. We need not fight now."
aloe.10.b:0 "No more games. Now we shall have war!"

aloe.11.t:0 "The Rightful Crown."
aloe.11.d:0 "Aloe has long been advocating for her right to rule Hungary as a true monarch, as was promised during the Treaty of Brugg when she was placed in charge of Hungary. However, the LHS placed Prime Ministers who were de facto more powerful than she was at the head of government. Many of these Prime Ministers were foolish and cowardly, unable to do what was required for the future of Hungary. Even moreso, they have simply let the threat of the Antis emerge and grow, without any attempt at stopping them. Aloe has gathered her key supporters and formed a movement around herself. \n \n This movement has reached new peaks, as the increasing failures of the Prime Ministers began to show. Yesterday, Aloe gave a fiery speech in Budapest, condemning the past Prime Ministers, and inisting that this was the 'Kingdom of Hungary' and always has been through history. It is only natural that Hungary is ruled by a king and who else than Aloe? She pledged to return Hungary to greatness, insisting that only through the power of a monarch would Hungary prevail. \n \n The people were stirred by her words, and the mob made its way to the Parliament with Aloe at its head. The Parliament guards stood down, and thus alowed Aloe to give eher warnings to Parliament. She promised none of them were to be harmed or in danger and she hoped that they would serve her well as functionaries of the state. At the end of the speech arose the final issue, asked by a foreign journalist in the country. "What does this mean for the future of Hungarian foreign politics?" All Aloe said was,"
aloe.11.a:0 "We shall remain with Yagoo."
aloe.11.b:0 "The Resistance will pave the way of the future."
aloe.11.c:0 "Hungary shall make its own way."

aloe.12.t:0 "Aloe Remains With Yagoo"
aloe.12.d:0 "After her seizure of power, Aloe was quick to answer any questions and dispel any fears about her new foreign policy. She confirmed that the reborn nation would remain with Yagoo and the LHS, for she always has and, for the foreseeable future, always will believe in Yagooism. \n \n In response to these messages, the LHS and all its members applauded the plans and loyalty of Aloe to their cause. There seems to be no foreign objections or disapproval of Aloe seizing power, especially in the light of this news. Several Resistance nations were disappointed that Aloe did not align herself to them, though they seem unsurprised."
aloe.12.a:0 "We have smoothed any ruffled feathers."

aloe.13.t:0 "Aloe Aligns Herself to the Resistance."
aloe.13.d:0 "A great upheaval in Hungarian politics has occured, with Aloe seizing control of the country with the support of the people, crowning herself King of Hungary. Upon being asked about her new foreign policy, specifically her alignment to the LHS, Aloe was careful yet precise in her answer. "Our foreign policy plans will require changes and careful consideration, for the current status-quo is not working for Hungary or its people." She paused, then continued. "I believe it is only through cooperation within a new system, such as what the Resistance champions, that we may be able to work towards a better, more prosperous future." While said very diplomatically, the meaning was clear to all, a nation rather close to the core of the LHS had flipped for the Resistance. \n \n While no official response or overture was made by Resistance governments, it is reported that Resistance leaders celebrated the news, preparing to welcome their new ally into their ranks. \n \n Unsurpisingly, the nations which make up the backbone of the LHS are dismayed and disgusted with the news. Several LHS officials have gone on to say they are disappointed in Aloe, yet not surprise that such a showing would come from her. Yagoo himself did not respond back to requests for comments or quotes, but his office has announced that unless Aloe made serious reversals in her plans, it could lead to serious economic embargos and penalties from the LHS."
aloe.13.a:0 "The Resistance is the future."

aloe.14.t:0 "Aloe's Glorious Restoration"
aloe.14.d:0 "Aloe, with the support of the people, has seized control of Hungary. She has declared herself  Queen of Hungary, announcing that Hungary and her people alone shall determine its future. When asked by a journalist what this means for the future of Hungary's ties with the LHS, Aloe had a simple response. "We no longer need the LHS, just as we dont need the Resistance. Hungary's strength comes from within, from its own people. Only we can grasp our own destiny, so we can leave those two to their own squabbling and fighting, for they are foolish and short sighted. Hungary shall take its future into its own hands, I do only hope that my friends and former allies do not find themselves in my way." \n \n In response to such a bold and determined sentence, the journalists quieted down with no further questions. After this an aide brought out the Royal Crown of Hungary, protected and stored since the time of the Hapsburgs. Without ceremony or further words, Aloe placed the crown upon her head. A perfect fit."
aloe.14.a:0 "To the New Queen of Hungary!"

aloe.15.t:0 "Yagoo Gives Us Support."
aloe.15.d:0 "Due to the conflict in our country, we have beseeched Yagoo and the LHS for aid in our struggle. Yahoo was quick to pledge his support of our cause. We should expect to see further aid, especially in the way of materials, from the LHS in the near future."
aloe.15.a:0 "Thank you, Mr. Yagoo!" 

aloe.16.t:0 "LHS Armaments"
aloe.16.d:0 "A shipment has arrived in Budapest, courtesy of the LHS. To our delight, we found several crates containing small arms and munitions for our cause. Aloe, who was expecting the shipment, was delighted to hear the news, sending several messages of thanks to Yagoo and the LHS as a whole."
aloe.16.a:0 "We will use them well, Mr. Yagoo!"

aloe.17.t:0 "Yagoo Abandons Us!"
aloe.17.d:0 "In response to the recent conflict in our country, Aloe has gone to Yagoo and the LHS in order to ask for help. Aloe, and all of Hungary, felt confident that the LHS would support their cause, for they do uphold the tenets of Yagooism. With that in mind, Aloe asked for some support in the war, in the way of armaments. \n \n Much to Aloes surprise and horror, though, she found that Yagoo had turned his back on Hungary. Yagoo cited the irrelevance of Hungary as his reason for not supporting their cause. Additionally, in his message, he called Aloe a 'lacking' leader of an unstable and unworthy country.. "
aloe.17.a:0 "What the fuck Yagoo?"

aloe.18.t:0 "The Guns of Yagoo"
aloe.18.d:0 "A great train pulled into Budapest's martial train station, bearing LHS markings. After unloading the train, we found ourselves overwhelmed with the sheer amount of equipment in this shipment. Around 2,000 LHS rifles have found their way into our hands. Aloe publicly broadcasted a message of thanks to the LHS, ensuring them that the weapons would be put to good use for a just cause. This is a significant win for the Pro-LHS and Pro-Yagoo forces, visible proof that the council can in fact deliver results."
aloe.18.a:0 "For Yagoo! For the LHS!" 

aloe.19.t:0 "Nothing to Spare"
aloe.19.d:0 "Despite Aloes repeated requests and efforts, Yagoo, and the LHS as a whole, have denied our requests for weaponry and equipment. They maintain that they support our cause to the end, but regret to say that the LHS simply cannot spare any equipment for Aloes stricken nation. This bodes ill for the Pro-LHS forces.."
aloe.19.a:0 "Then we must fight alone."

aloe.20.t:0 "Yagoos Offer"
aloe.20.d:0 "Aloe has asked for help and arms several times before, but none of these requests have been taken seriously. After the latest rounds of insistent requests by Aloe, Yagoo has been simple and blunt in his answer. If Aloe is to take equipment from the LHS then she must provide something in return. They would only equip her forces if every LHS rifle was paid for in full, in advance. This deal is not equal for both sides, blatantly serving to profit Yagoo and the LHS, at Aloes expense. Such a thing is difficult for a nation in such a severe struggle, but if Aloe is to succeed she may find herself forced to accept such a deal...."
aloe.20.a:0 "Fine.." 
aloe.20.b:0 "We don't need this!"

aloe.21.t:0 "End of the Civil War."
aloe.21.d:0 "The last of the Anti holdouts and strongholds have been toppled. Aloe soldiers stormed the Anti defenses and captured their leadership. Brought to Budapest, the Grand Marshal of the Anti forces was forced to broadcast a message across Hungary. All Anti forces are to stand down as the Revolutionary Anti Government has capitulated. Most of the fighting has stopped, with only small rebel cells, which are being surrounded by Aloe forces. \n \n After the Grand Marshal finished, Aloe spoke on the broadcast, declaring ultimate victory for the people of Hungary. She promised that now peace and prosperity would be brought to this nation, newly revitalized by the crucible of war. The Hungarian people cheered in the streets upon the announcement being finished, the streets of Budapest filled with the singing of the Hungarian national anthem."
aloe.21.a:0 "Now begins the reconstruction"

aloe.22.t:0 "The Anti Question."
aloe.22.d:0 "After the fighting ends, one question still remains: What is to be done with the defeated? Whether or not their loyalty and previous actions, they are still Hungarians. However, treason is still a crime of the highest order. This decision can be left to none but Aloe herself, who ponders the ramifications of this question. \n \n To let the accused go would certainly go a long way towards reconnecting the ties between the Hungarian people, uniting a war torn people. The negative to this, though, is it could let the threat of the Antis grow in power to threaten Aloe and Hungary once more. \n \n To punish or condemn the accused to a drastic degree would prevent future uprisings and revolutions against aloe's reign. However, it could cause unrest among our people, not to mention harsh reprisals could further damage our nation. "
aloe.22.a:0 "Treason is Treason. No exceptions."
aloe.22.b:0 "We must mend these wounds, not cut off the limb."

aloe.23.t:0 "Yagoo Approves Financial Aid."
aloe.23.d:0 "We have requested aid from Yagoo, which he has been kind enough to approve of. Due to the dire war and unrest in our country, Yagoo agrees that LHS funding should back Aloe in her cause. We can use this funding to support the war effort as we see fit. We owe many thanks to Yagoo for this, let us hope we use it well."
aloe.23.a:0 "Thank you, Mr. Yagoo!"

aloe.24.t:0 "Yagoo Denies Financial Aid."
aloe.24.d:0 "We have requested LHS funds and aid to support the effort facing our country, however we have received a negative answer from Yagoo. He wishes to support our cause, however due to budgetary constraints and other issues that face the LHS, he simply cannot fund our cause. Should the LHS have had the excess funds necessary, he would have supported us, he claims. It seems not even the deep pockets of Yagoo and the LHS are infinite."
aloe.24.a:0 "We understand, Mr. Yagoo…"


aloe.25.t:0
aloe.25.d:0
aloe.25.a:0

aloe.26.t:0 "White Terror."
aloe.26.d:0 "Following the bloody struggle for the fate of Hungary, King Aloe solidified her position as the sole power in Hungary. Few officially challenge her power, especially after her victory in the Hungarian Civil War. However, a secretive movement has formed in the wake of the Anti defeat, a movement which has found support in some local governments. After several higher officials were found covering up traces of the movement, a member of the Hungarian Intelligence Agency brought evidence of these actions to aloe. \n \n Aloe took action, without restraint or delay. Royalist agents, acting on Aloes orders, seized these higher level supporters and imprisoned lower level officials. Show trials were held for these Anti-sympathetic officials, all of them sentenced to public execution. In response these officials held a variety of different reactions, some pleading forgiveness and others stoic in response to the sentences, all personally administered by Aloe herself. \n \n During these trials, the Intelligence Agency procured and publicized the full plans of the Antis, which included bombings throughout major cities. These plans were to be followed by a rush on the Royal Palace, at which point they planned on executing Aloe on a public television broadcast. Thankfully, these evil plans were prevented by Aloes loyal intelligence officers. \n \n In response to this evidence, the pro-Aloe citizens of Hungary were outraged, wishing to demonstrate their full loyalty to Aloe and her regime. Several attacks on known Anti newspapers and shop owners were carried out by Hungarian citizens. Many Antis were beaten, with some small few being killed in the attacks. Aloe has proclaimed forgiveness for these citizens, who she says acted in honorable passion, but warned them that any further incidents would have to be punished."
aloe.26.a:0 "Grim, albeit necessary."

aloe.27.t:0 "Night of the White Terror."
aloe.27.d:0 "During the second night of the attacks on the Antis, which is being called the White terror, several hundred Antis in the capital of Budapest have formed a militia. They call themselves the Independent Rákospalota Zone, named for the small neighborhood of Budapest which they occupy, declaring their independence from the rest of Hungary. Although numbering less than 300, they have barricaded the streets and buildings in the small neighborhood. The wealthier neighborhood has seen the small estates turned into strongholds, with the neighborhood cathedral being used as the makeshift stronghold of the movement. \n \n Seeing this, Aloe and the rest of the Hungarian high command decided that enough was enough. Aloe ordered the national guard as well as a detachment of the Budapest garrison to take back the small neighborhood. The Hungarian military utilized armored trucks to breach the defenses of the neighborhood, which was supported by police snipers and squad tactics. The defenders initially broke and retreated in response to their makeshift ramparts being broken down. The Anti forces regrouped at the Cathedral, denying the two attempts by a negotiator to defuse the conflict. \n \n Upon the failure of diplomacy, Hungarian forces besieged the Cathedral for over 13 hours, with several defenders being killed, while only a few Hungarian personnel were wounded. The resilience of the old Cathedral, as well as good defensive positions made breaching the Cathedral impossible. Hungarian forces fired canisters of tear gas through the stained glass of the cathedral, which the defenders tried their best to withstand. After threats of lethal gas, many of the defenders trickled through the rear of the Cathedral into police lines. After this, the Anti rebels surrendered and were brought into Hungarian custody. Nearly all have been sentenced to life in prison. In total several dozen rebels were killed and 278 were brought into custody. Hungarian forces suffered less than two dozen wounded and only two casualties."
aloe.27.a:0 "Foolishness."  


aloe.28.t:0 "The Royalist Mob" 
aloe.28.d:0 "In the wake of Aloe restoring the power of the Monarchy, the majority of Hungarians were overjoyed and celebrating. However the Antis were dismayed and outraged. As we all know now, though, Aloe solidified her power and restored unity to Hungary, defeating the Antis once and for all. The few Antis left were pardoned by Aloe, for she believed that they were Hungarians first and foremost. Aloe proclaimed that although they were misguided and tricked by the Anti leadership, most of the common Anti rebels were acting for what they saw as the greater good for Hungary. She declared that any Anti, besides their leadership, who renounced their Anti beliefs and swore to continue standing for a reborn Hungary, would be forgiven of all wrongdoings. \n \n Touched by Aloes grace, many Antis returned to the embrace of Hololivism, swearing their loyalty to Aloe and to Hungary. This event was held in public, for all the Hungarian people to see, as wayward Anti figures and leaders were returned to the light of Hungary once more. However a small minority refused to accept Aloes forgiveness, swearing that they would be the ones to topple Aloes regime, yelling for all the crowd to hear. They shouted profanities and insults, swearing to do unspeakable things to all of the Hololive regime. The crowd roared in outrage, yet graceful Aloe said nothing. She directed all of the forgiven and pardoned Antis to be brought to safety. Aloe then ordered her guards and retinue to pack up and go, leaving the stubborn or blind of the Anti leaders behind, still bound in handcuffs. \n \n The mob, after only a few moments, surged forward from the streets, into the central square of Budapest. They descended upon the Anti leaders and savaged them, beating them in the streets of Hungary. The Anti leaders were hung in the historic center of Budapest, loyal Hungarians cheering their victory of the Antis. As word was brought to Aloe in her royal palace she simply smiled and continued drinking her tea. Her loyal Devil Friends fought for her so fiercely, it made her proud to be their Monarch."
aloe.28.a:0 "The Justice of the People" 

aloe.29.t:0 "The Kossuthist War"
aloe.29.d:0 "Most who initially stood against Aloes reign as King of Hungary have since grown to appreciate our ruler, preferring her to the previous Hapsburgs or democratic notions. A small few have stubbornly held onto their liberal and socialist ideals, following the doctrine and beliefs left behind by the treasonous Lajos Kossuth, an infamous figure of the Hungarian reformists and revolutionaries.  \n \n The prime offenders are the so-called 'Sons of Kossuth', a heavily armed, liberal militia, who operate in clusters throughout the country. They have been a thorn in the side of Hungary ever since the Treaty of Bruggs. Hopeful revolutionaries took up arms, believing they would be given democratic rule over Hungary, however they perceived Aloe's ascension to the throne as an insult and betrayal, thus they vowed to always stand against Aloe and her Hungary. The movement was vocal at first, during the formative years of Aloes reign, at which point the movement went quiet, causing the Hungarian government to believe it had run out of steam. However, this seems to have not been the case. \n \n Intelligence agents have reported of a group operating under the same name in hidden underground meetings throughout Hungary, however it is unknown if they draw their lineage from the original group. Several letters and manifestos have been written to local governments, all written in different styles with differing demands, suggesting that the rebels are operating in local clusters, only united by name and ideals. As most of these demands have been rejected, there has been an escalation by the group. Several railways, factories, and power plants have received threats of bombing and sabotage. It would appear a rebel movement has formed under the very nose of Aloe, seeking to uproot her rule. It must be dealt with."
aloe.29.a:0 "We shall crush them!"

aloe.30.t:0 "The Counter Revolution"
aloe.30.d:0 "Aloe and her Royalist supporters have consolidated their power in Hungary, wrestling firm control in a world facing the aftermath of Bruggs. Enemies and revolutionaries pose a danger to Aloes new Hungary, though, threatening from both in and out of the country. Aloe has sworn that she shall take a stand against the threat of the revolution and liberalism, though, so that the livelihood and stability of Hungarian life may be protected. \n \n She has called herself the 'Bulwark Against the Revolution', iall of her allies and people to join her in her stance against the threat of liberals, socialists, and Antis, who all wish to tear apart a newly remade Hungary. Aloe has engaged in practices of curbing political opposition, ensuring that her iron grasp over Hungarian politics does not become loose. While some dissent and complain over these policies, many Royalist supporters and even common citizens approve of the taken measures. \n \n Only time will tell whether these policies will carry on in glory, or whether they will be uprooted and exterminated in a tide against Aloe; but the future seems to favor Aloe and the Royalists power over Hungary."
aloe.30.a:0 "For the Crown! For the Country! For Aloe!"

aloe.31.t:0 "The Czechs Refuse our Demands!"
aloe.31.d:0 "Despite Aloes demands that Slovakia be returned to Hungary, so that the Hungarian people may be united once more, the Czech government has refused to cede the territory to Hungary. They insist that Hungary's claims on Slovakia are invalid, lost in the Treaty of Bruggs and that should Hungarian troops cross the border into Czechoslovakia it would be an act of war. \n \n Aloe had threatened war should the Czechs not back down, despite this they have remained silent, though. The lost Hungarian people expectantly wait for the Hungarian army to arrive and bring them back under the Hungarian crown, but it remains to be seen if Aloe will act on her threats. The decision is now left in Aloes hands, will she press Hungary's claims or back down?"
aloe.31.a:0 "To arms! For our lost people!"
aloe.31.b:0 "Now is not the time."

aloe.32.t:0 "Czechs Partially Concede"
aloe.32.d:0 "While Aloe has demanded the whole of Slovakia be returned to Hungary, the Czech government has responded with a counter offer. They recognize that while Slovakia contains a sizable Hungarian minority, their census suggests that only southern Slovakia has a true Hungarian majority population. The Czech Ambassador, acting on behalf of his government, has proposed that Hungary annex Southern Slovakia, in order to fully govern this Hungarian population. The rest of Slovakia would remain under Czechoslovakian governance, however there would be ensured protections for Hungarians in the region. Additionally, they would ensure that should any present or future Hungarians wish to migrate to Southern Slovakia, or to the rest of Hungary, there would be no restrictions on their travel. \n \n The Czech Ambassador and government feel as though this is a fair and reasonable solution to the problem. They are also requesting that Slovakians and other citizens within Southern Slovakia be treated as fairly as any other Hungarian citizen, but due to their faith in Aloes governance they do not see the necessity for such a stipulation in the official treaty. They are stipulating, though, that after we accept this deal we should leave the Slovakian situation untouched for at least two decades, and not press any further claims on Czechoslovakian territory."
aloe.32.a:0 "All or nothing! For Hungarians everywhere!"
aloe.32.b:0 "That sounds fair. We accept."


aloe.33.t:0 "The Anti Purge"
aloe.33.d:0 "Antis have long threatened Hungary, a sizeable anti minority made Aloes reign tenuous at best, but recent conflict with the Antis has shown that they will not attempt to find common ground with us. They simply refuse to listen to reason or diplomacy, for they are so stubborn and filled with hate towards our Hololive ways. So long as the Antis exist in Hungary there can be no meaningful peace while Aloe is on the throne. They will not rest until their cursed blight has infected all of the world, bringing it back to the darkness of the old imperial europe. Aloe has long tried to win their hearts, yet they resist even her. No longer. Aloe has realized now that diplomacy has failed, now is the time for action. \n \n When one has an infestation you cannot merely kill the bugs which emerge from the darkness, one must uproot the entire group, bringing them into the light of the day. Once they are exposed to the light they can be exterminated. Let us commit ourselves to this cause, so that we may tear out the roots of the Anti movement and eradicate them from Hungary. They shall resist and some may call us extreme, yet we do only as we must, for the future of Hungary and all of her people. For Aloe!" 
aloe.33.a:0 "We shall cleanse the filth"

    
aloe.34.t:0 "Austria and Hungary Reunited!" 
aloe.34.d:0 "Aloe has long campaigned for the reunification of Austria and Hungary, believing that only if the two work together can they stand as a major power. Under her new power, Hungary is now stabilized and ready, looking back towards Vienna. Aloe publicly broadcasted her offer, both in Hungarian as well as Austrian German. The two nations of Austria and Hungary would be united once more, the Dual monarchy restored through aloe. \n \n In response to this broadcast, Austrians cheered in the street, proclaiming the renewal of their once great nation, hand in hand with Hungary. The Austrian government, after hastily working out terms which left most of them in charge of their previous positions of power, accepted the broadcast as reality. The President of Austria, Kurt Schuschnigg, was given the position of First Austrian Minister, preserving most of his powers, but confirming his subordinate role to aloe. \n \n Thus Aloe, along with a procession of her advisors and guards, crossed the Austrian border into the previous capital of Vienna. There she spoke with many prominent Austrian figures and gave a speech to a crowd of thousands of Viennese. She celebrated the revival of the Austro-Hungarian union, declaring that both the Austrian and Hungarian people were building a new legacy and future, so that the next generation would enjoy the fruits of this rebirthed Empire!"
aloe.34.a:0 "Austro-Hungarian Unity!"

aloe.35.t:0 "Austria Refuses Reunion"
aloe.35.d:0 "The Hungarian and Austrian people, no matter how different our languages and customs may be, were always destined to be together. Hand in hand, our union held power over much of Europe, forcing others to respond to our unity and power. Aloe has long championed for the reunification of our peoples, however she only recently made her true move. She demanded the Austrian government, in accordance with the past and the wishes of its people, accept reunification with Hungary. \n \n Her plan was to allow much of the Austrian government to remain intact, simply ruling over both countries as one monarch. However the Austrians have rejected her demands, insisting that they shall follow their own path. \n \n Aloe has decried the Austrian government, insisting them as blindly following the failures of Bruggs. Now she has two choices, should she press her claims while they are recent or should she back down from reunification with Vienna?"
aloe.35.a:0 "We shall restore the dual monarchy!"
aloe.35.a:0 "Now is not the time."

aloe.36.t:0 "The German Situation"
aloe.36.d:0 "It is well known that Germany—  or rather what once was Germany, has become a land of strife and divides. Once united in 1871 by the legendary Otto von Bismarck, Germany is now divided among many powers. To the north, the White Fox Army under Fubuki holds Hamburg. To the west, Subaru governs much of Lower Saxony. In the south, Kiara rules much from the Rhine region to Bavaria. In Pomerania and Brandenburg, the German Reich governs the capital of the old Germany, Berlin. Holding Prussia, Silesia, and the land of the Poles, Noel is the power of Eastern Germany. All these different forces, except for perhaps Subaru, vie for the reunification of Germany under their flag, to restore themselves and the Reich to greatness. \n \n Most of these powers are involved in their own struggles, unable to push forward without foreign intervention or another faction attacking as a third party. Two of these competitors, though, have started searching for a supporter in their cause. Diplomats have arrived from both Munich, under Kiara, as well as Warsaw, on behalf of Noel. They both seek our aid in this conflict, so that they may be victorious in uniting Germany. \n \n Noel, from the East, asks us support her in the coming struggle. Kiara, from the South, has also petitioned Aloe for backing. This leaves Aloe in a decisive position to cause an immense change in the balance of power in the conflict for Germany. Supporting one of these factions would obviously harm our relations with the other, but would ensure our friendship with the other. Should Aloe back Kiara or Noel?"
aloe.36.a:0 "Kiara brings the future!"
aloe.36.b:0 "Noel is righteous!"

aloe.37.t:0 "Noel Concedes Western Galicia"
aloe.37.d:0 "In response to Aloes demands, Noel has decided to comply. As of this morning, Noel has peacefully transferred control of Western Galicia to aloe. She asks that Aloe please treat the people of the territory, Hungarian or not, kindly and fairly. Noel has also requested that in exchange for her compliance, Aloe refrain from pressing any further claims. \n \n Hungarians cheer as Aloe announces the latest success for the expanding Hungary. Many are hopeful for the future friendship between Noels Germany and Aloes Hungary."
aloe.37.d:0 "Three cheers for Noel and Aloe!"

aloe.38.t:0 "Noel Denies Us!"
aloe.38.d:0 "After sending her demands to Noel, Aloe heard nothing from Warsat Noel flat out denied any chance of the lanaw. After sending a diplomat to Noel, Aloe was horrified when Noel sent word that her diplomat had been sent away, back to Budapest. \n \n Noel said that her new future was bright and powerful, her new nation forged stronger. She says that she is under no obligation to cede territory to Aloe, but with her nations backing she simply chooses not to give Aloe the land. She finished her conversation with Aloes diplomat with a single sentence. \n \n "What are you going to do about it?""
aloe.38.a:0 "I will tear down everything you have built."
aloe.38.b:0 "Damn you. Damn you Noel."

aloe.39.t:0 "Flare Condedes Eastern Galicia"
aloe.39.d:0 "In response to Aloes demands, Flare withdrew into her room for several hours. Upon emerging, Flare responded to Aloes demands with a single word. "Fine". Flare has ordered her garrisons to withdraw from the territory, reportedly to the dismay of several non-Hungarian citizens of the region. It matters not, though, for righteous Hungarian formations have marched across the border and raised their flag over towns throughout Eastern Galicia. \n \n In a public speech with grandeur and cheering crowds, Aloe announced to the Hungarian people the latest expansion of the Hungarian people. They are ever so close to completely uniting the lost Hungarians, to restoring their lost power to its former peak. She has proclaimed that the meteoric rise of Hungary shall not end, not while she leads this most glorious nation."
aloe.39.a:0 "Hungary even higher!"

aloe.40.t:0 "Flare Refuses Our Demands" 
aloe.40.d:0 "Despite Aloes clear insistence in her demands that Eastern Galicia be ceded to Hungary, Flare has refused any and all possibility of Galicia being given to Hungary. She swears that she and her people will stand, all united, even if only for one corner of her country. Though her people may not share a single national identity, she swears that all her people will stand to protect one another. \n \n She sent her official response to Aloe, followed by a taunt. "I will never give into the demands of a bully! Just try to abuse a people standing together!" All that remains to be seen is Aloes response." 
aloe.40.a:0 "Lets test that idea!" 
aloe.40.b:0 "Whatever, we dont need Galicia" 

aloe.41.t:0 "Beyond Hungarian Borders?" 
aloe.41.d:0 "As Hungarys borders have rapidly expanded, forming a major power in central and eastern europe, some have begun to question how far Aloe intends to conquer. It has become a key question of the Hungarian people, as they lay at a crossroads. Now Aloe must decide on which direction to take Hungary, she must decide how grand their ambitions may be. \n \n Some advocate for peace, believing that Hungarys borders have grown as far as they can in one generation. They insist that to push any further would be madness and hubris combined. Others believe that Hungary is still not yet at its precipice, that they can push this even further. They believe that Hungary may still yet be greater, for their are still some few Hungarians and historic regions not yet under Hungarian flag again. A devoted few advocate for an even further escalation, they claim that it is due to Aloes royal nature and status that she is given claim to the old Hapsburg dynasty. They insist that Aloe could claim the Hapsburg mantle, seeking to restore their lost territories and domains under Hungary. \n \n And so, in a speech on the matter in the the historic city center of Budapest, Aloe declares to the crowd just what Hungarys ambitions are:" 
aloe.41.a:0 ""Our realm is large enough as is. Let us govern."" 
aloe.41.b:0 ""It is Hungarys destiny to become even greater!"" 
aloe.41.c:0 ""Aloe est imperare orbi universo."" 
       
aloe.42.t:0 "The Hololive Kingdom"
aloe.42.d:0 "The great schism between those who support the LHS and Hololivism compared to the Antis who support the old world order only grows wider every the day, something Hungary is all too aware of. Much of the conflict comes from Hungary often being called the 'Hololive Kingdom of Hungary'. Many Hungarians support the Antis, or at least express some distrust or negative opinion of the LHS and hololivism at large. Aloe has fiercely struggled with asserting her authority over Hungary as these Antis pose are such a destabilizing factor in the kingdom. \n \n If we could establish common ground, it would go a long way towards uniting the people of Hungary behind Aloe, Anti or not. A proposed concession to the Antis is an official renaming of Hungary and declaration on the status of the kingdom. Some of Aloes ministers believe that if Aloe were to distance herself from the LHS and formally remove all mentions of Hololive and the new order in the Hungarian government, it might yet lead to collaboration from the Antis. \n \n This is however a bold move, one that is certain to draw ire from Yagoo and the LHS. Aloe must consider whether we shall sacrifice our LHS roots in order to work with the conservative and Antis of Hungary, or if Hungary shall remain committed to her place in the LHS."
aloe.42.a:0 "Hungary is and always will be Hololivist."
aloe.42.b:0 "We are ALL Hungarian first."
       
aloe.43.t:0 "Hungarian Elections"
aloe.43.d:0 "The excitement in Budapest and all of Hungary has reached a fever pitch. Aloe announced a new set of elections, which are to be free and fair for all Hungarians to vote in. She has ensured that the LHS nor Resistance, nor any other foreign or domestic powers, shall influence the results of this election. She has campaigned for these elections, which begin now. The people are enthusiastic and hopeful at the news of the elections, at least in the cities. Several in the rural regions still distrust these new elections, but nonetheless they shall proceed. \n \n The voting shall occur throughout the day, at which point the votes shall be tallied. Eager talk buzzes through Hungary, as people debate who they think will win the elections; the progressives or conservatives? \n \n The progressives lean towards Yagoo and the LHS, favoring internationalism and the great ideals of hololivism. The conservatives, on the other hand, place Hungary first, supporting Hungarian business and industry. As the votes are tallied, Aloe is informed of the count and given permission to announce the results to the public. After a brief introduction, thanking the citizens for voting, Aloe began to announce the results, \n \n "I am excited to announce, that after a long day of voting, after constant back and forth in the polls, a victor has been decided. Narrowly winning out over their opposition, victory goes to the...""     
aloe.43.a:0 ""Progressive Party!""
aloe.43.b:0 ""Conservative Party!""
       
aloe.44.t:0 "Together for Aloe!"
aloe.44.d:0 "The Hungarian people have moved past their fiercest political differences of the past, all coming together in unity for one great idea. They now stand together, regardless of our past conflicts and divisions. Other nations are united by ideals or common struggle; but we believe in a higher ideal. We believe that all Hungarians shall come together in service of their beloved Homeland! \n \n While foreigners may look down on us or believe themselves superior, we know the truth. We are Magyars! We are brought together as one under Hungary! All to show the rest of the world the brilliant light that shines from Budapest! We shall restore the great legacy of Matthias Corvinus and Louis I. Once more our domain shall be washed upon by three different seas, through the strength of Hungarian arms and with the fire of Hungarian spirit!"
aloe.44.a:0 "Manotomo unite!"
       
aloe.45.t:0 "Manotomo Volunteers Organized!"
aloe.45.d:0 "The surrounding world seems set on bringing down Aloe and tearing Hungary down with her, but we shall not stand for such threats! The Hungarian people are proud of their Queen and even more proud of their great nation. As tensions rise volunteers have flooded recruiting offices across the country. No Manotomo man who is able to wield a weapon would refuse such a noble calling. \n \n While none are profesional soldiers and most bring only family hunting rifles or weapons from the Great war, they are proud to serve. \n \n It shall take time to process and train any more soldiers, though, for the military is in a dilapidated state after years of neglect. However the young and the soldiers of Hungary are eager to fight, let us use their enthusiasm as the backbone of our army. We now march forward, re-armed and with high spirits!" 
aloe.45.a:0 "To Arms! For Aloe!"
       
aloe.49.t:0 "The Streets Run Red"
aloe.49.d:0 "Despite the government's amnesty for many officials who joined the Anti cause, the people of Budapest still remain fervant in their stance against anyone who opposes their Queen.\n\nToday when a group of former Antis approached their office, they were shot dead by ex-soldiers who had fought in the recent Civil War. Incidents like this are frequent and often go unpunished. Fearing for their lives, many of those who had supported the revolution have gone into hiding."
aloe.49.a:0 "Damn!"
