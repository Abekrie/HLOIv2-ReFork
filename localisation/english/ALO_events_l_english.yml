aloe.1.t:0 "Proposition from Suisei"
aloe.1.d:0 "This morning a transmission arrived in Budapest from France, containing a simple proposition from Suisei. It appears that she has offered us the choice of bending the knee before her power over Europe, wishing for us to be brought under her fold peacefully, without bloodshed. She demands that French troops and authority be given jurisdiction over our lands, so that they may enforce French will. One thing is clear, however, even if we are to refuse, Suisei will not simply take no for an answer."
aloe.1.a:0 "This is the best choice."
aloe.1.b:0 "We shall govern ourselves."

aloe.2.t:0 "Results of the Yagoo Conference."
aloe.2.d:0 "The LHS, at the behest of Yagoo, has convened a great meeting in Belgrade over the past weeks. The LHS discussed the best course of action for the compounding problems facing the LHS and Yagooslavia. We were scarcely able to influence the course of the conference, as it primarily came down to Yagoo and his most trusted or powerful states discussing their future approach to world affairs. There were three main outlooks debated at this conference. \n \n The first was internationalism, which is the traditional LHS approach. These conservative thinker advocated for upholding the LHS status-quo. They would support Hololivism, and especially Yagooism, around the world. They would build their influence in these regions, blocking Resistance or Anti ideas from cultivating their growth. The people of those regions, for all intents and purposes, still governed themselves, but they would be obliged to follow LHS rules and protocols. This is the expected decision from the conference, but it does us little favors. We should mainly expect the LHS meddling in our affairs if this is to be result of the conference. \n \n The second set of ideals advocated is called Regionalism. It primarily revolves around letting each region handle its matters on the whole, but wherever LHS allies and interests lay they would still influence and build ties as necessary. It largely advocates a more hands off global force, except for whenever it's in their direct backyard or associated with close allies of Yagoo. This is our preferred outcome, as it would allow us to handle our affairs as we see fit, but should matters complicate or we found ourselves in trouble we could always call upon Yagoo and the LHS to assist us. \n \n The final, minority mindset is Yagooslav nationalism. This is the worst situation we can imagine, if this is the outlook determined at the Yagoo conference. The Yagooslav nationalists wish to see Yagooslav focus all the power of the LHS inside Yagooslavia, so as to build their direct power. From there, they wish to exert their control over their neighbors and then influence the rest of the world as a sole major power. This is especially worrying due to our close proximity to Yagooslavia, leaving us a prime target for the Yagooslav nationalists. We must hope this is not the result of the Yagooslav conference."
aloe.2.a:0 "That was not ideal."
aloe.2.b:0 "Splendid!"
aloe.2.c:0 "Damn, the situation has changed!"

aloe.3.t:0 "Anti Revolution in Hungary!" 
aloe.3.d:0 "Anti Protests across Hungary have reached their peak, the nation has fallen into civil war. Anti protestors in Debrecen raged across the city throughout the day, but at night the rioters did not disperse. They seized control of the city hall, declaring their intent to bring down Aloe and the pro-LHS regime in Hungary. The rebels, calling themselves the 'Hungarian National Government' have found little support or recognition in the wider world. The local police sided with the rebels, forcing the military garrison to withdraw from the city. The city mayor, being pro-Aloe, was executed in the city center alongside his government. \n \n Aloe has sworn that she shall avenge the mayor and crush the rebels, without quarter. Most in the Hungarian government have pledged their support to Aloe, condemning the revolutionaries. In response to the outbreak of war, many Aloe generals have sided with Aloe in this conflict, however a certain few, as well as several army formations and units, have broken contact, citing that their support for the Anti cause. The LHS has condemned the rebels, but have taken no action and no meaningful support has arrived for Aloes' cause, causing some to question their usefulness to Hungary. Several who support Aloe have even suggested leaving the LHS, due to their failure to support Aloe's government. \n \n The Antis pledge that they are fighting for the Hungarian people as well as all the people of the world. Their new National Government has promised that Hungary shall become a haven and sanctuary from LHS ideals. While extremely few foreign governments officially support them, they have the extensive approval of the Anti movements in all parts of the world. The government of Japan has officially recognized the National Government, however they have not promised any support or volunteers. The Antis have decreed that every man shall fight to the end, to form a bastion against Holovism in Europe. \n \n Now begins the Civil war in Hungary, Aloe seeking to put down the revolution and opposition which has overtaken her country and beloved ideals, while the Antis seek to take back their home from what they see as foreign and power-hungry tyrants. Now the world watches, as the treaty of Brugg tears at the seams in Hungary."
aloe.3.a:0 "Down with Aloe! For Hungary!"
aloe.3.b:0 "We must put down this threat!"
aloe.3.c:0 "The LHS has clearly abandoned us"

aloe.4.t:0 "Transylvania Seized!"
aloe.4.d:0 "While we were distracted by our own modern, fighting a fierce struggle for our own survival and security, Mel has betrayed and attacked us. Troops following Mels orders marched across the border, seizing Transylvania. They claim that they are only safeguarding the territory for us, so that they may keep it safe from rebels and antis. They are clearly traitorous and scheming in their plan, simply preying upon us while we are down!"
aloe.4.a:0 "Damn."

aloe.5.t:0 "Unvar Seized!"
aloe.5.d:0 "Czechoslovakia has marched their troops across our border once more, seizing the territory of Unvar. They claims that they are acting in the interests of peace, so that they may protect their territories and peoples within. They are clearly opportunistic, attacking us while we are weak."
aloe.5.a:0 "Damn." 

aloe.6.t:0 "Unvar Returned!"
aloe.6.d:0 "After our requests and difficulties, we have made a breakthrough in our diplomacy. The Czech government has conceded, and in interests of community and friendship, will return the territory of Unvar to our people. The transfer is set to take place without delay, in a small ceremony. \n \n Some claim this is not enough, though, with many jingoistic and aggressive members of governments calling for Slovakia to also fall under our control. This may ruin the opportunity to build relations with the Czech government, though, for a demand like this may come down to force. The decision comes down to Aloe in the end."
aloe.6.a:0 "We stand triumphant."
aloe.6.b:0 "Unvar is not enough!"

aloe.7.t:0 "Translyvania Returned!"
aloe.7.d:0 "After weeks of diplomatic demands and threats, Mels troops have finally withdrawn from Transylvania. They cite that their peacekeeping mission is over, and that the people of Transylvania are no longer granted protection by Mel. Mel has formally invited Aloe to return her authority to the region. The people of Hungary celebrate, for our long lost brothers and kin in Transylvania are now returned to Hungary!"
aloe.7.a:0 "Tranyslvania shall remain with us."

aloe.8.t:0 "The Czechs Refuse Our Demands!"
aloe.8.d:0 "We have sent a list of demands to the Czech government, insisting that the Czech return Unvar to us at once, for that territory is rightfully ours. The Czech government has refused, saying that they shall protect the citizens of Unvar from us. Such nonsense cannot be tolerated. We shall liberate our kin and brethren who wrongfully forced to live under the Czech yoke. However to push this issue any further would result in a war, as the conflict would quickly spiral out of our control. Let us be sure we are ready for the burden of a war."
aloe.8.a:0 "Now is not the time to press the issue."
aloe.8.b:0 "We shall not accept this!"

aloe.9.t:0 "Mel Refuses Our Demands!"
aloe.9.d:0 "We have long pressed for Transylvania to be returned to Hungary, so that we may restore the Hungarian people to Hungary. However Mel has repeatedly ignored our requests, declaring that the people of Transylvania are rightfully under her protection. She has declared that Hungary has no legal claim or rights to Transylvania. It does not appear as though she will back down on this issue, which leaves us with a predicament. We must either fight for our people, or resign to settle this conflict another day."
aloe.9.a:0 "We are not able to fight Mel now."
aloe.9.b:0 "To arms! We must go to war !"

aloe.10.t:0 "Slovakia Refuses Our Demands!"
aloe.10.d:0 "Despite our rightful claims on Southern Slovakia and our insistent demands for our territory and people to be returned to us, Mel has refused to return the territory to us. They have turned away our diplomats empty handed and claim Southern Slovakia is theirs. If we are to press our claims now we could find ourselves in a war, let us be sure we are ready for such a conflict."
aloe.10.a:0 "Patience. We need not fight now."
aloe.10.b:0 "No more games. Now we shall have war!"

aloe.11.t:0 "The Rightful Crown."
aloe.11.d:0 "Aloe has long been advocating for her right to rule Hungary as a true monarch, as was promised during the Treaty of Brugg when she was placed in charge of Hungary. However, the LHS placed Prime Ministers who were de facto more powerful than she was at the head of government. Many of these Prime Ministers were foolish and cowardly, unable to do what was required for the future of Hungary. Even moreso, they have simply let the threat of the Antis emerge and grow, without any attempt at stopping them. Aloe has gathered her key supporters and formed a movement around herself. \n \n This movement has reached new peaks, as the increasing failures of the Prime Ministers began to show. Yesterday, Aloe gave a fiery speech in Budapest, condemning the past Prime Ministers, and inisting that this was the 'Kingdom of Hungary' and always has been through history. It is only natural that Hungary is ruled by a king and who else than Aloe? She pledged to return Hungary to greatness, insisting that only through the power of a monarch would Hungary prevail. \n \n The people were stirred by her words, and the mob made its way to the Parliament with Aloe at its head. The Parliament guards stood down, and thus alowed Aloe to give eher warnings to Parliament. She promised none of them were to be harmed or in danger and she hoped that they would serve her well as functionaries of the state. At the end of the speech arose the final issue, asked by a foreign journalist in the country. "What does this mean for the future of Hungarian foreign politics?" All Aloe said was,"
aloe.11.a:0 "We shall remain with Yagoo."
aloe.11.b:0 "The Resistance will pave the way of the future."
aloe.11.c:0 "Hungary shall make its own way."

aloe.12.t:0 "Aloe Remains With Yagoo"
aloe.12.d:0 "After her seizure of power, Aloe was quick to answer any questions and dispel any fears about her new foreign policy. She confirmed that the reborn nation would remain with Yagoo and the LHS, for she always has and, for the foreseeable future, always will believe in Yagooism. \n \n In response to these messages, the LHS and all its members applauded the plans and loyalty of Aloe to their cause. There seems to be no foreign objections or disapproval of Aloe seizing power, especially in the light of this news. Several Resistance nations were disappointed that Aloe did not align herself to them, though they seem unsurprised."
aloe.12.a:0 "We have smoothed any ruffled feathers."

aloe.13.t:0 "Aloe Aligns Herself to the Resistance."
aloe.13.d:0 "A great upheaval in Hungarian politics has occured, with Aloe seizing control of the country with the support of the people, crowning herself King of Hungary. Upon being asked about her new foreign policy, specifically her alignment to the LHS, Aloe was careful yet precise in her answer. “Our foreign policy plans will require changes and careful consideration, for the current status-quo is not working for Hungary or its people.” She paused, then continued. “I believe it is only through cooperation within a new system, such as what the Resistance champions, that we may be able to work towards a better, more prosperous future.” While said very diplomatically, the meaning was clear to all, a nation rather close to the core of the LHS had flipped for the Resistance. \n \n While no official response or overture was made by Resistance governments, it is reported that Resistance leaders celebrated the news, preparing to welcome their new ally into their ranks. \n \n Unsurpisingly, the nations which make up the backbone of the LHS are dismayed and disgusted with the news. Several LHS officials have gone on to say they are disappointed in Aloe, yet not surprise that such a showing would come from her. Yagoo himself did not respond back to requests for comments or quotes, but his office has announced that unless Aloe made serious reversals in her plans, it could lead to serious economic embargos and penalties from the LHS."
aloe.13.a:0 "The Resistance is the future."

aloe.14.t:0 "Aloe's Glorious Restoration"
aloe.14.d:0 "Aloe, with the support of the people, has seized control of Hungary. She has declared herself  Queen of Hungary, announcing that Hungary and her people alone shall determine its future. When asked by a journalist what this means for the future of Hungary's ties with the LHS, Aloe had a simple response. “We no longer need the LHS, just as we dont need the Resistance. Hungary's strength comes from within, from its own people. Only we can grasp our own destiny, so we can leave those two to their own squabbling and fighting, for they are foolish and short sighted. Hungary shall take its future into its own hands, I do only hope that my friends and former allies do not find themselves in my way.” \n \n In response to such a bold and determined sentence, the journalists quieted down with no further questions. After this an aide brought out the Royal Crown of Hungary, protected and stored since the time of the Hapsburgs. Without ceremony or further words, Aloe placed the crown upon her head. A perfect fit."
aloe.14.a:0 "To the New Queen of Hungary!"

aloe.15.t:0 "Yagoo Gives Us Support."
aloe.15.d:0 "Due to the conflict in our country, we have beseeched Yagoo and the LHS for aid in our struggle. Yahoo was quick to pledge his support of our cause. We should expect to see further aid, especially in the way of materials, from the LHS in the near future."
aloe.15.a:0 "Thank you, Mr. Yagoo!" 

aloe.16.t:0 "LHS Armaments"
aloe.16.d:0 "A shipment has arrived in Budapest, courtesy of the LHS. To our delight, we found several crates containing small arms and munitions for our cause. Aloe, who was expecting the shipment, was delighted to hear the news, sending several messages of thanks to Yagoo and the LHS as a whole."
aloe.16.a:0 "We will use them well, Mr. Yagoo!"

aloe.17.t:0 "Yagoo Abandons Us!"
aloe.17.d:0 "In response to the recent conflict in our country, Aloe has gone to Yagoo and the LHS in order to ask for help. Aloe, and all of Hungary, felt confident that the LHS would support their cause, for they do uphold the tenets of Yagooism. With that in mind, Aloe asked for some support in the war, in the way of armaments. \n \n Much to Aloes surprise and horror, though, she found that Yagoo had turned his back on Hungary. Yagoo cited the irrelevance of Hungary as his reason for not supporting their cause. Additionally, in his message, he called Aloe a 'lacking' leader of an unstable and unworthy country.. "
aloe.17.a:0 "What the fuck Yagoo?"

aloe.18.t:0 "The Guns of Yagoo"
aloe.18.d:0 "A great train pulled into Budapest's martial train station, bearing LHS markings. After unloading the train, we found ourselves overwhelmed with the sheer amount of equipment in this shipment. Around 2,000 LHS rifles have found their way into our hands. Aloe publicly broadcasted a message of thanks to the LHS, ensuring them that the weapons would be put to good use for a just cause. This is a significant win for the Pro-LHS and Pro-Yagoo forces, visible proof that the council can in fact deliver results."
aloe.18.a:0 "For Yagoo! For the LHS!" 

aloe.19.t:0 "Nothing to Spare"
aloe.19.d:0 "Despite Aloes repeated requests and efforts, Yagoo, and the LHS as a whole, have denied our requests for weaponry and equipment. They maintain that they support our cause to the end, but regret to say that the LHS simply cannot spare any equipment for Aloes stricken nation. This bodes ill for the Pro-LHS forces.."
aloe.19.a:0 "Then we must fight alone."

aloe.20.t:0 "Yagoos Offer"
aloe.20.d:0 "Aloe has asked for help and arms several times before, but none of these requests have been taken seriously. After the latest rounds of insistent requests by Aloe, Yagoo has been simple and blunt in his answer. If Aloe is to take equipment from the LHS then she must provide something in return. They would only equip her forces if every LHS rifle was paid for in full, in advance. This deal is not equal for both sides, blatantly serving to profit Yagoo and the LHS, at Aloes expense. Such a thing is difficult for a nation in such a severe struggle, but if Aloe is to succeed she may find herself forced to accept such a deal...."
aloe.20.a:0 "Fine.." 
aloe.20.b:0 "We don't need this!"

aloe.21.t:0 "End of the Civil War."
aloe.21.d:0 "The last of the Anti holdouts and strongholds have been toppled. Aloe soldiers stormed the Anti defenses and captured their leadership. Brought to Budapest, the Grand Marshal of the Anti forces was forced to broadcast a message across Hungary. All Anti forces are to stand down as the Revolutionary Anti Government has capitulated. Most of the fighting has stopped, with only small rebel cells, which are being surrounded by Aloe forces. \n \n After the Grand Marshal finished, Aloe spoke on the broadcast, declaring ultimate victory for the people of Hungary. She promised that now peace and prosperity would be brought to this nation, newly revitalized by the crucible of war. The Hungarian people cheered in the streets upon the announcement being finished, the streets of Budapest filled with the singing of the Hungarian national anthem."
aloe.21.a:0 "Now begins the reconstruction"

aloe.22.t:0 "The Anti Question."
aloe.22.d:0 "After the fighting ends, one question still remains: What is to be done with the defeated? Whether or not their loyalty and previous actions, they are still Hungarians. However, treason is still a crime of the highest order. This decision can be left to none but Aloe herself, who ponders the ramifications of this question. \n \n To let the accused go would certainly go a long way towards reconnecting the ties between the Hungarian people, uniting a war torn people. The negative to this, though, is it could let the threat of the Antis grow in power to threaten Aloe and Hungary once more. \n \n To punish or condemn the accused to a drastic degree would prevent future uprisings and revolutions against aloe's reign. However, it could cause unrest among our people, not to mention harsh reprisals could further damage our nation. "
aloe.22.a:0 "Treason is Treason. No exceptions."
aloe.22.b:0 "We must mend these wounds, not cut off the limb."

aloe.23.t:0 "Yagoo Approves Financial Aid."
aloe.23.d:0 "We have requested aid from Yagoo, which he has been kind enough to approve of. Due to the dire war and unrest in our country, Yagoo agrees that LHS funding should back Aloe in her cause. We can use this funding to support the war effort as we see fit. We owe many thanks to Yagoo for this, let us hope we use it well."
aloe.23.a:0 "Thank you, Mr. Yagoo!"

aloe.24.t:0 "Yagoo Denies Financial Aid."
aloe.24.d:0 "We have requested LHS funds and aid to support the effort facing our country, however we have received a negative answer from Yagoo. He wishes to support our cause, however due to budgetary constraints and other issues that face the LHS, he simply cannot fund our cause. Should the LHS have had the excess funds necessary, he would have supported us, he claims. It seems not even the deep pockets of Yagoo and the LHS are infinite."
aloe.24.a:0 "We understand, Mr. Yagoo…"
