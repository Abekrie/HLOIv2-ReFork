france_bad_category_desc:0 "After the §yGeneva Agreement§! and the §yTreaty of Brugg§!, France was divided into numerous §Roccupation zones§! set to be returned to the French state by §y1928§!. While, Kiara and Watson withdrew out of the Vosges-Meurthe-et-Mosselle and Normandie regions, Subaru and Suisei have remained in their §Roccupation zones§! in Loire-Mayenne and Picardie-Oise till this day. \n \nThis has been a contentious issue between the §dLHS§! and the French state and has been one of the driving factors for the rise of the §RResistance§!. As the various §RResistance factions§! gain more influence in the French government, more friction and distrust will grow between the §dLHS§! and France."
