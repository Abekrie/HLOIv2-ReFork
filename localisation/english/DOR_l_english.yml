DOR_doris: "Doris"
DOR_doris_desc: "Doris is the governor of Shandong and founder of the Doris Dynasty, a new noble house established by Doris and her supporters. She is a hardcore monarchist and holds a claim to the Mandate of Heaven, seeking to become the new Empress of China.\n\nDoris was part of the original Hololive China branch council members who governed over the entirety of China, where she controlled Shandong and a large portion of the Eastern provinces of China and parts of the Yangtze. She was consistently at odds with how the Council ran due to its Republican principles and when the Council collapsed, Doris retreated to Shandong and removed herself from the action, still claiming the Mandate of Heaven with her as the Empress. Doris bore the brunt of the Japanese invasion and occupation, and spent much of her time post-war rebuilding Shandong.\n\nDoris is still working to rebuild and industrialize Shandong after the Japanese invasion. She still maintains her claims to the Mandate of Heaven and seeks to take down the LHS's republican rule over China."
