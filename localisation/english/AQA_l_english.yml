AQA_minato_aqua: "Minato Aqua"
AQA_minato_aqua_desc: "Known across the world as the founder of the Resistance, Minato Aqua was the first idol to break away from Yagoo and the LHS in order to establish her new vision. A vision where idols and their people will throw off the chains of capitalism and establish a society without the divisions of class and wealth.\n\nAqua arrived in Brazil at the dawn of the 20th century, like many other idols. During her time as a maid in Rio de Janeiro, Aqua witnessed Brazil's countless civil strifes, from mutinies, strikes, protests, and the harsh crackdowns from the ruling government against these displays of discontent. During this time as the other idols prepared their revolutions, Aqua had a falling out with Yagoo, who insisted she was not ready to lead Brazil's people due to her being a maid. Feeling betrayed, Aqua would break ties with Yagoo and after following Pekora's readings, she would create her own manifesto titled Os Choros dos Cortiços (The Cries from the Cortiços). Her book would soon be banned, but as Brazil's economy plummeted, it became more and more popular among those from the lower and middle classes, especially common soldiers. Eventually the sparks of discontent grew into the flames of rebellion. Led by Aqua, various Brazilian leftist groups overthrew the government, establishing Aqua as their new leader.\n\nEstablishing control over Brazil, Aqua began to implement her ideology, nationalizing private and foreign enterprises and reorganizing the government to better suit her leftist vision. Still rejecting Yagoo and what she views as the capitalist and reactionary LHS, Aqua founded The Resistance to not only counter Yagoo's global order, but to one day spread her revolution world wide."
