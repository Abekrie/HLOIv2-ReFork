AQA_minato_aqua_trait: "Backroom Revolutionary"
AQA_minato_aqua_trait_desc: "Known across the world as the founder of the Resistance, Minato Aqua was the first idol to break away from Yagoo and the LHS in order to establish her new vision. A vision where idols and their people will throw off the chains of capitalism and establish a society without the divisions of class and wealth.\n\nAqua arrived in Brazil at the dawn of the 20th century, like many other idols. During her time as a maid in Rio de Janeiro, Aqua witnessed Brazil's countless civil strifes, from mutinies, strikes, protests, and the harsh crackdowns from the ruling government against these displays of discontent. During this time as the other idols prepared their revolutions, Aqua had a falling out with Yagoo, who insisted she was not ready to lead Brazil's people due to her being a maid. Feeling betrayed, Aqua would break ties with Yagoo and after following Pekora's readings, she would create her own manifesto titled Os Choros dos Cortiços (The Cries from the Cortiços). Her book would soon be banned, but as Brazil's economy plummeted, it became more and more popular among those from the lower and middle classes, especially common soldiers. Eventually the sparks of discontent grew into the flames of rebellion. Led by Aqua, various Brazilian leftist groups overthrew the government, establishing Aqua as their new leader.\n\nEstablishing control over Brazil, Aqua began to implement her ideology, nationalizing private and foreign enterprises and reorganizing the government to better suit her leftist vision. Still rejecting Yagoo and what she views as the capitalist and reactionary LHS, Aqua founded The Resistance to not only counter Yagoo's global order, but to one day spread her revolution world wide."

aqua.1.t: "Kanata Urges Intervention"
aqua.1.d: "Kanata has sent us a request for us to help her out against Coco in retaking Veracruz and her Northern Mexican states. This could be our chance to kick the revisionist Coco down a notch and support a comrade of the Revolution, but it could drive a wedge further between us and Coco, hurting chances of the Resistance reconvening to fight the LHS."
aqua.1.a: "Coco has clearly violated the Resistance's principles, send Kanata our support"
aqua.1.b: "It's not worth it..."

aqua.2.t: "Coco Refuses to Back Down"
aqua.2.d: "Coco has refused to back down from Kanata’s demands at Veracruz and Northern Mexico, and it seems like Coco is lining up her troops across the border for a punitive expedition. We should not condone fellow Resistance members fighting each other, but at the same time a war with Coco would be incredibly costly and works to further weaken the Resistance."
aqua.2.a: "Then war it is"
aqua.2.b: "The cost is too great..."
