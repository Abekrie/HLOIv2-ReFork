OLI_kureiji_ollie: "Kureiji Ollie"
OLI_kureiji_ollie_desc: "Kureiji Ollie is the leader of the underground Peoples' Zomrade Front, a left leaning guerrilla army operating underground largely in LHS Malaya and parts of Indonesia proper with the goal of overthrowing LHS rule in Malaya and domination of Indonesia. Ollie leads the Zomrades with great, powerful energy and a positive attitude that keeps the organization motivated throughout its years of staying underground.\n\nOllie arrived in Malaya working in a rubber plantation under the British and endured numerous workplace accidents while noticing that workers were abused under harsh colonial conditions. Ironically, Ollie acquires a scholarship to go to school in Britain where she develops trade unionist and syndicalist views. Upon returning to Malaya, she was a unionist for several years and participated in the Hololive Revolution. She pushed for Malaya to have a union with Indonesia but was locked out by the LHS's desire to directly administer Malaya, which soured her relations with Yagoo. As such she turned to Aqua and Coco for assistance.\n\nOllie's Zomrades are still underground, but as the LHS's global grip weakens and Indonesia deteriorates, she can finally rise up against Yagooist oppression to overthrow the LHS Malaya government and use it as a springboard to spread the revolution into Indonesia."
