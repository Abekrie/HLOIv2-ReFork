lore_summary_content_loc: "Before the early 20th century the world was one much more familiar to us. Empires cast their shadow over much of the earth, and the global powers drew ever nearer to war. Then, as far back as 1899, a group of time travellers arrived. Led by their leader Yagoo, the members of the idol company Hololive strove to prevent The Great War from occurring and spread messages of world peace. However, rather than preventing The Great War, they inadvertently brought it upon the world much earlier. The existing order, fearing Hololive's influence, found an excuse when a paramilitary led by Pekora raided a Turkish garrison which was used as the justification to invade Serbia, kicking off the 1912 Balkan War. As The Entente tried to contain the Ottomans, the Central Powers entered the war on behalf of the Ottoman Empire. Due to their anti-war messages, the Hololivers became targets of harsh censorship from both The Entente and Central Powers. As a result, the Hololivers and their vast amounts of followers rose up and fought brutal uprisings, which brought one country after another to their knees. The fighting ceased in 1919 with the signing of the Treaty of Brugg, bringing an end to the war that Hololive travelled back in time to stop.\n \n In only a decade the world had drastically changed. Formerly vast and mighty empires were brought to their knees, their lands shattered and divided amongst the idols. These new Hololive states redrew the map and crudely imitated the nations that once stood before them. However, although the end of The Great War brought 10 years of brutal fighting to a stop, it did not bring an end to the chaos that Hololive had to contend with. In the final years of the war, disagreement arose between the idols as each laid claim to different territories, only to be disappointed when their claims were not satisfied in The Treaty of Brugg. This was coupled with a rise in worker's strikes, protests and partisan attacks in the wake of post-war economic collapse. They also questioned the original motive of global peace in favour of peace that they alone would dictate. To ensure further cooperation between the idols, and to further secure his influence, Yagoo formed the £lhs_texticon|1 League of Hololive States (L.H.S). Despite this, peace was merely a dream for Yagoo and his idols as sabre rattling, rebellions and civil unrest became the norm in place of compromise and negotiation. This internal chaos was followed by external tensions between the various idols. In 1930 due to resentment against Yagoo for not satisfying her territorial claims, Aqua and a number of other idols seceded from the L.H.S. Together they formed The Resistance, an organisation dedicated to usurping Yagoo's global influence.\n\n Now in 1936, the world is more divided than even before the Hololivers arrived. Yagoo attempts to maintain his global reach and keep his Idols in line, while Aqua's Resistance works to end his global hegemony and further influence the world on their own terms. At the same time various Anti-Hololive individuals plot to break their nations free from Hololive influence and return the former glory of their homelands. The future now lies in the hands of the Hololivers, who's promises of peace seem long forgotten."

ideology_summary_lhs_ideology: "Pro-Yagoo Conservatives are upholders of the status quo, being ardent defenders of traditional family, social, and moral values. Yet they are also open to small-scale change, and with the establishment of the LHS after the Treaty of Brugg, the Pro-Yagoo Conservatives have embraced the new order as the best way to defend their old values. They also have found an ally in laissez-faire capitalism, which they argue can preserve moderation and self-determination.\n\nFormed as a fusion ticket between traditional conservatives and classical liberals, Pro-Yagoo Conservatives steadily rose in popularity as a way to counterbalance the rising left-wing. However, as time went on, and these forces became more and more radical, Pro-Yagoo Conservatives have found their positions increasingly untenable as more of the population dissents from the status quo. Of course not all hope is lost, as they have only deepened their ties to the ideals of global cooperation and trade, hoping that the prosperity from these tenets can help them weather the storm.\n\nPro-Yagoo Progressives have seen the coming of the LHS as the opportunity they have been waiting for to create a new fairer and more just system for all. Noting that the old ideas of the past have marginalized various groups, they seek to uplift those in the lower classes to create a more equal society. Unlike their more revolutionary cousins however, Pro-Yagoo Progressives prefer to achieve this via reform with existing LHS institutions rather than tearing everything down to build a new perceived utopia.\n\nHowever, such a viewpoint is starting to lose steam as more revolutionary and populist movements are beginning to take root as the populace increasingly sees the more moderate and reformist policiesas not doing enough to solve the fundamental issues. In response, Pro-Yagoo Progressives have been forced to work with their former partisan opponents to present a united front against the radicals. Only time will tell whether or not  this will work.\n\nEven though the LHS may claim to be the defenders of liberty and democracy in the world, their members are not all uniformly democratic. Indeed, some reactionary politicians and Hololivers see the Hololivers as a sign of a higher power, and thus the resumption of a divine right to rule. While Pro-Yagoo Monarchists range from nominally constitutional to absolute, their governments are still illiberal in nature. However, they still cooperate with the LHS, whether they view the LHS leadership as similarly enlightened as their own or simply out of pragmatic national security interests.\n\nThe LHS on the other hand mostly view Pro-Yagoo Monarchists with suspicion, as their democratic credentials are debatable at best. They fear that the presence of monarchies within their ranks may undermine the message of the LHS as a force for democracy and peace. Nonetheless, the LHS still tolerates them as they provide a bulwark against the rise of more hostile ideologies; Resistance and Anti alike.\n\nThese groups are much more self-serving than ideological in nature, and for one reason or another, have found that cooperation with the LHS is the best way to get their agenda forward. Generally corrupt and often personalistic, these kleptocrats will stop at nothing to maintain their hold on power.\n"

ideology_summary_resistance_ideology: "A spectre is haunting the world; the spectre of revolutionaries. Birthed from Marxist theory, Pro-Resistance Revolutionaries believed that a radical restructuring of society must occur towards the proletariat against  the bourgeois classes. They view the founding of the LHS as just another plot by the ruling classes to maintain their hold on power while continuing to oppress the working class.\n\nThey have found an ally in similarly-disatisfied Hololivers, who seek to provide an alternative to the Yagooist order. Many of said Hololivers feel the same way, viewing the founding of the LHS as a betrayal of the populist rhetoric that got many of them into power. They vow that, as long as they draw breath, the workers of the world must unite to overthrow such systems to finally achieve peace for the underprivileged.\n\nPro-Resistance Nationalists are jingoists, who always place their country first. They see the degeneration of the LHS and they resolve to protect their nation from it. While they still believe in Hololiver leadership, they view them as a way to benefit the nation first rather than serving a global elite.\n\nThis world view is extremely similar to their Revolutionary counterparts, but if one was to mention this to a Resistance Nationalist, they would scoff and deflect any such relation. "The Revolutionaries are too idealistic!" "Their efforts to bring an international revolution will only be met with failure at the hands of the LHS!" "Better to focus on one nation and to build it up so that they may truly vanquish the forces of capital on the world!" Despite these differences, they are still willing to form a united front against the globalist tendrils of the LHS.\n\nHow can one come to terms with the divine right of Hololivers in conjunction with their grassroots populist support? According to Resistance Monarchists, they believe that the Hololiver can fulfill both these roles at the same time. By combining the best of both reaction and revolution, they hope to fulfill such a perfect system.\n\nJust like the other Resistance ideologies, Pro-Resistance Monarchism also holds many deep suspicions over the true goals and beliefs of Yagoo"s LHS system. However, while the others talk about working-class or national solidarity, Pro-Resistance Monarchists are more focused on venerating the Hololiver itself. Only then will the people"s long-sought out needs be finally satiated.\n\nThese groups are much more self-serving than ideological in nature, and for one reason or another, have found that cooperation with the Resistance is the best way to get their agenda forward. Generally corrupt and often personalistic, these kleptocrats will stop at nothing to maintain their hold on power."

ideology_summary_anti_ideology: "Some nationalists do not consider the existence of Hololivers enough to fully address a nation"s problems. Viewing Hololivers as just another force seeking to take their country down, these idealogues represent a new, much more radical form of nationalism, centralized around its leaders and committed against all of its perceived enemies, no matter what they are.\n\nWhile one may assume New Nationalism and Resistance Nationalism as ideological brothers, they have no love for each other. Similarly, their relations with other Resistance ideologies are also hostile, as they see all of them as sellouts to the Hololivers. They even have shaky relations with other Antis, only cooperating them in the short-term to fight against the Hololivers before likely turning on them for further control. They view all of these as aloof at best and traitorous degenerates at worst, equally as bad as the Hololivers they claim to fight against. They therefore seek to eventually cleanse all opposing influence to maintain a united resolve for the nation.\n\nMankind is meant to be equal and free from the shackles of government tyranny, and yet all throughout history has mankind found itself under these boots. From the kings of old to the dictators of today, a new force has arrived only to also prove itself to be one of the tyrants dressed in saviour"s clothing; the Hololivers. While many of them claim to be for democracy, democratic revitalizationists inherently distrust them due to their common flirtations of autocracy that announced their wake.\n\nDemocratic revitalizationists are diverse, ranging from normal liberals who just want to curtail the influence of the LHS to radical anarcho-capitalists who seek to tear down any oppressive state structure to usher in true market freedom. But all of them have a shared dream, that the tree of liberty may finally be planted, no matter how many tyrants have to fall to get that to happen. \n\nA spectre is haunting the world; the spectre of revolutionaries. And from the writings of figures such as Marx and Kropotkin a new red wave has swept in from the left. Calling for the means of production to be seized back to the workers who produced it, and the abolition of bourgeois structures that constantly oppress the worker, the radical left-wing has swelled in popularity with its promises of peace, bread, and equality for all.\n\nUnlike the revolutionaries that break bread with the Resistance however, some radicals view the Hololivers as a threat to the promised utopia. After all, don"t they also enrich themselves and their cronies to reap the benefits of their rule while the proletariat languish and starve? They especially hold grievances to the LHS - yet another structure made to enrich the global ruling class. The Hololivers have proved where their true loyalties lie; now it is time for the people to strike back.\n\nThe Enlightenment and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. The ancient royal houses have had their divine right to rule stripped away in favour of degeneration by the masses. At least, this is what Reactionary Monarchists think. The most reactionary of the reactionaries, they long for the return of the pre-Enlightenment era when absolutism in accordance with Heaven"s grace made a ruler instead of the common rabble.\n\nWhile a lot of monarchists welcome the Hololivers, viewing their appearance as proof that they have the divine right to rule, these reactionaries distrust them. They doubt the Hololivers, even the more autocratic-leaning ones, will truly return life to how it used to be. Only absolutism by true royal blood can save the country, finally righting past wrongs.\n"

ideology_summary_neutral_ideology: "Is there any purer love than love for one"s country? Ever since the revolutions and counter-revolutions of the late-18th to early-19th century, the idea that states should be constructed around a national identity has firmly implanted itself, with adherents stretching throughout the world. Seeking brotherhood with their compatriots in foreign lands, reactionary nationalist strive to have their nation be made fully whole, adopting revanchist policies to take back lost territories and reunite their long cast-off brothers.\n\nUnlike New Nationalists however, Reactionary Nationalists aren"t uniformly opposed to the existence of Hololivers, instead adopting a more neutral approach. After all, if the Hololiver helps in realizing their dream of national fraternity, why should they be opposed? While they still dislike the internationalist dreams of more idealistic Hololivers and the LHS system, they will still align with more statist Hololivers if they share the same national dreams.\n\nThere are those in politics that stick to their ideals. They always seek one worldview, base their ideology in that worldview, and carry out the tenets of that worldview. Of course, the world rarely works like such, according to mixed-ideology democrats. No matter whether they are socialist, conservative, or liberal, mixed-ideology democrats champion pragmatism as the main goal. Composed as a ‘big tent" faction, they all share the same love for the country they live in, and thus feel the need for dialogue with one another rather than quarrelling and degenerating into partisan politics.\n\nFollowers of this philosophy present themselves as a fourth way between LHS, Resistance, and Anti forces. Emphasizing the need for neutrality, they will do what they think is best, and align themselves with whomever seems to benefit the country the most. Of course the question of what happens if the varying factions of a mixed-ideology democracy start disagreeing with each other pops up, due to the broad-front nature of the group. Nevertheless, those who agree with this philosophy still assert that, even though they may have their disagreements, pragmatism and the common national interest will still ultimately prevail.\n\nThe origins of the Hololivers are shrouded in great mystery. Some consider them to be just ordinary folk that just slipped through the cracks before finally shining through, while others consider them chosen by a greater purpose to lead their nation to destiny. But of course there are those that view the Hololivers themselves as otherworldly; a being that should be held in higher regard than their subjects before them. These are the followers of the Divine Mandate, who seek to build a national faith over the Hololiver based on their divine nature.\n\nSuch a situation could mean that the Hololiver in question can now be empowered to move beyond the traditional LHS-Resistance divide. It also compels them to build a highly personalistic, highly moralistic, and (often times) highly nationalistic regime as they start to think of a more independent foreign policy to go down towards; one that befits godly figures more than figures of mankind.\n\nThese groups are much more self-serving than ideological in nature, and for one reason or another, have found that neutrality between parties is the best way to get their agenda forward. Generally corrupt and often personalistic, these kleptocrats will stop at nothing to maintain their hold on power."

WTS_tutorial_paths_background: "Amelia Watson travelled back in time to 1899 in British South Africa during the 2nd Boer War. She had enlisted as a field army nurse for the British Colonial Army and tended to the hundreds of wounded at the Battle of Modder River. While as a nurse, she was also experimenting with plants, herbs, and chemicals to create remedies and concoctions. Her finest creation; "Watson's Concoction" proved to be highly effective and even more so when paired with certain medicines. By 1903, Amelia would be decorated with the Royal Red Cross and the Order of Merit later on in 1907. She would be wholeheartedly welcomed into Great Britain itself in 1904, from there she would meet notable British figures.\n\nArriving in Britain. Watson would continue her work in the medicinal field while also slowly dabbling into politics, especially regarding colonial affairs. Her comments on the subject matter earned her both fame and notoriety amongst the British Aristocracy. From 1906, Ame would join the upper class and establish a "gentleman's club" of her own known as the "Teammates Society". There they would discuss concurrent matters of the empire from both liberal and conservative perspectives. She would make speeches about the colonies, having experienced them first hand while also speaking for suffrage and free trade among other things. Although she wasn"t allowed to be a member of Parliament, Amelia had power to influence several of them and soon, many smaller Teammate Societies formed up from all across the isles. Often with unifying or contradicting ideals and ideologies. \n\nTensions would rise across Britain as the idea of revolution grows louder and louder from all social classes. The Irish lower class and the Ulster Teammates were more in favour of revolution as the latter were disillusioned with Yagooist ideals and British influence in Ireland was slowly waning. On the other hand, the upper classes elsewhere were either hesitant or against the idea, as the disorder and instability of a revolution would descend them into chaos. \n\nWhen the Great War began in 1912. The British government made measures to prevent strikes and demonstrations but 2 weeks later a riot broke out in Northern Ireland by Irish Republicans which led to the intervention of government and several paramilitary forces, including the Teammates. Reports of rising casualties and violence led to the British Army sending a fully armed battalion to replace and subdue the paramilitaries. In turn, Amelia would organise secret meetings with her Teammates in order to influence her upper class members for her own revolution, despite her contrary Yagooist views. Later on  in June 1912 when the Athens Revolt broke out, Draft dodging became more common and public opinion across Britain  plummeted to a low, deteriorating the stability and war effort of the country. At the Battle of Athens. British forces were being beaten back and surrendering in droves to the "Hololive Army". The situation at the homefront was not made any better as the creation of the British Home Guard and Public Order Authority, in order to suppress and contain any insurrectionists. This only inspired the Irish Republican Army and the Scottish National Movement to launch uprisings and demonstrations against the British government. \n\nThe world powers soon decided that the uprisings by the Hololive Revolutionaries were quickly destabilising their nations and decided that a ceasefire was needed in order to suppress these revolutionaries before hostilities could recommence. On May 1st, 1916, the Treaty of Verdun would be signed. Bringing the Great War to a sudden halt. It did not however put a halt to the dissatisfaction amongst the British Parliament as they argued whether or not to repeal the wartime acts. It all came to a head when on September 13th, Amelia Watson led the Teammates Revolution after months of careful planning. Organized militias were emerging from across Britain, seizing and besieging key cities. Loyalists and Counter-Revolutionaries also mobilised and made resistance movements against the Teammates while other revolutionaries emerged to claim their home territory from the Teammates. It had become an all out free-for-all for dominion over the whole British Isles. Hostilities would die down and finally cease in 1920 with Amelia Watson claiming the whole of Britain, Scotland, and Wales while most of Ireland was held by the Irish Liberation Army under Ceres Fauna.\n\nWhat emerged from the revolution was a Hololive kingdom with no monarch, Amelia as regent and nothing but ruins. Many of the towns and cities had been destroyed and depopulated as a result. Centuries of wealth had been wiped away in less than a decade and everything had to be rebuilt from the ground up. Measures were taken to speed up reconstruction, but it led to a  hyperinflation in 1924 where Watson had to seek assistance from other Hololive Nations. Unfortunately, the revolution also brought confusion and disillusion for many supporters. They were promised a golden age would come to Britain with someone like Amelia Watson at the helm but instead were left with the shattered remain of their once great homeland.\n\nDespite her best efforts, a "New Nationalist'' movement was forming in Scotland and parts of London in the late 1920s. In 1927, nearly half of the population in major industrial cities would have partaken in their movements. Further south, Amelia was seen as a puppet-master in Parliament however it couldn"t be proven by any LHS investigation. Elections would frequently result in National Teammate Front (NTF) victories, however their power and popularity had dwindled over the decade. They could not stand as a united front, but as a coalition of larger and smaller factions, such as the Royal Amelia League, Ulster Teammates, Workers" Alliance, and the Liberal Republicans. They divide themselves on whether or not Ameila should be crowned Queen of England, or reform Britain into a Hololive Republic. But to those who are either not in the NTF (whether the New Labour Movement or the Crown Party), or those not taking sides, they want Watson out of politics entirely.\n\nThe rise of "New Nationalists" led to more suppression and more resentment towards Amelia, especially since the Watson Secret Service was established as a way to stop the rising dissent. On April 23rd, 1928, the New Nationalist Party, the "Society of English Patriots", were supposed to launch a coup after months of planning and preparation, but their leaders were immediately caught and the followers scattered. They went into hiding but continued to spread more propaganda leaflets and brought an increasing public distrust in Amelia"s government, worsening her economic, industrial, and social situation. In June 1931, an uprising emerged in Scotland after a garrison was raided. An army was sent to suppress them but was attacked by an large English guerilla force outside of Lancaster and was forced back, and surrendered in Manchester. It was now clear that Amelia was weakened and that now was the time for the Kingdoms of Scotland and England to proclaim independence and for the Republic of Ireland to reunite. What resulted was a bloody war of attrition that neither could win, With support from other LHS nations, Amelia and her Ulster Teammates managed to retake Northern Ireland but couldn"t take Manchester and anything further north. Realizing that neither side can go on, both sides agreed to the Easter Accords in 1936. Although hostilities may have ended, both sides are biding their time and preparing for the next war."
