lore_summary_content_loc: "Before the early 20th century the world was one much more familiar to us. Empires cast their shadow over much of the earth, and the global powers drew ever nearer to war. Then, as far back as 1899, a group of time travellers arrived. Led by their leader Yagoo, the members of the idol company Hololive strove to prevent The Great War from occurring and spread messages of world peace. However, rather than preventing The Great War, they inadvertently brought it upon the world much earlier. The existing order, fearing Hololive's influence, found an excuse when a paramilitary led by Pekora raided a Turkish garrison which was used as the justification to invade Serbia, kicking off the 1912 Balkan War. As The Entente tried to contain the Ottomans, the Central Powers entered the war on behalf of the Ottoman Empire. Due to their anti-war messages, the Hololivers became targets of harsh censorship from both The Entente and Central Powers. As a result, the Hololivers and their vast amounts of followers rose up and fought brutal uprisings, which brought one country after another to their knees. The fighting ceased in 1919 with the signing of the Treaty of Brugg, bringing an end to the war that Hololive travelled back in time to stop.\n \n In only a decade the world had drastically changed. Formerly vast and mighty empires were brought to their knees, their lands shattered and divided amongst the idols. These new Hololive states redrew the map and crudely imitated the nations that once stood before them. However, although the end of The Great War brought 10 years of brutal fighting to a stop, it did not bring an end to the chaos that Hololive had to contend with. In the final years of the war, disagreement arose between the idols as each laid claim to different territories, only to be disappointed when their claims were not satisfied in The Treaty of Brugg. This was coupled with a rise in worker's strikes, protests and partisan attacks in the wake of post-war economic collapse. They also questioned the original motive of global peace in favour of peace that they alone would dictate. To ensure further cooperation between the idols, and to further secure his influence, Yagoo formed the £lhs_texticon|1 League of Hololive States (L.H.S). Despite this, peace was merely a dream for Yagoo and his idols as sabre rattling, rebellions and civil unrest became the norm in place of compromise and negotiation. This internal chaos was followed by external tensions between the various idols. In 1930 due to resentment against Yagoo for not satisfying her territorial claims, Aqua and a number of other idols seceded from the L.H.S. Together they formed The Resistance, an organisation dedicated to usurping Yagoo's global influence.\n\n Now in 1936, the world is more divided than even before the Hololivers arrived. Yagoo attempts to maintain his global reach and keep his Idols in line, while Aqua's Resistance works to end his global hegemony and further influence the world on their own terms. At the same time various Anti-Hololive individuals plot to break their nations free from Hololive influence and return the former glory of their homelands. The future now lies in the hands of the Hololivers, who's promises of peace seem long forgotten."


lhs_resistance_summary_button_loc: "LHS and Resistance"
lhs_resistance_summary_content_loc: "The goal of Yagooism from the start was to establish a new global order that would see the collaboration of all the Hololivers in a united world government that would benevolently rule according to the principles of its ideology. This idea had already broken down even before the LHS was formalized in 1927. From as early as the 1900s, prominent members such as Pekora, Aqua, Coco, and many others either directly opposed the idea of a global system, desired a more 'democratic' organization of the LHS, or disregarded it entirely as it stood in their path of power. Regardless of its favour with the public or amongst the Hololivers, the idea of a global Yagooist government were planned to take place once the Great War was over and initially seemed promising. However once the Great Anti Revolutions of 1919 brought many Hololive governments to their knees, the decades of planning had been discarded and a more pragmatic approach of treaties, acts, laws and unspoken rules were established instead. By 1924 however, this system was showing cracks and its non-standard nature called on many to push for reforms. These reforms were finalized in 1927 when the LHS was finalized as a merger of all the prior treaties and agreements that had been signed from 1920-1921. Despite its name, many Hololivers opted out of the LHS and view the organization as a threat to their own regional influence. With the destabilization of the global economy and the collpase of democratic institutions, more countries look away from the LHS every day and view the organization as it is; corrupt, bloated and doomed to fail.\n\nThe Resistance prior to the 1920s was not a coherent ideology, nor a global organization like the LHS; rather it was position in opposition to Yagooism. Based on Pekora's original criticism of Yagooism's pacifism and bourgeois democracy, it was determined that a revolution was necessarily in order to create the global utopia originally intended by the Hololivers time travel to the past. Aqua expanded on the revolutionary ideas by expanding it to not just a political revolution, but a socio-economic one which was to uproot the reactionary liberal system that kept the rich rich and the poor impoverished. This heavily Marxist inspired view was soon put under pressure as the news which came out of post-Great War Australia, Brazil, Chile and Mexico shocked the world. This reaction alongside the increasing radical nationalism that came as a result of the globalized world system resulted in Coco's interpretation of revolution which involved the syncretisation of the workers and capitalists under the state. The increasingly hostile and diverging ideas of the Resistance did not prevent the formal establishment of the Resistance in 1930 as a direct competitor of the LHS. The intention of the formation of the Resistance was to bring the ideological Resistance together in order to oppose the Yagooists together as one. Instead, the formal Resistance has only showed how fractured and incoherent the ideologies are, as both sides, the Aquaists and the Cocoists, vie for power and influence."

ideology_summary_lhs_ideology: "Pro-Yagoo Conservatives are upholders of the status quo, being ardent defenders of traditional family, social, and moral values. Yet they are also open to small-scale change, and with the establishment of the LHS after the Treaty of Brugg, the Pro-Yagoo Conservatives have embraced the new order as the best way to defend their old values. They also have found an ally in laissez-faire capitalism, which they argue can preserve moderation and self-determination.\n\nFormed as a fusion ticket between traditional conservatives and classical liberals, Pro-Yagoo Conservatives steadily rose in popularity as a way to counterbalance the rising left-wing. However, as time went on, and these forces became more and more radical, Pro-Yagoo Conservatives have found their positions increasingly untenable as more of the population dissents from the status quo. Of course not all hope is lost, as they have only deepened their ties to the ideals of global cooperation and trade, hoping that the prosperity from these tenets can help them weather the storm.\n\nPro-Yagoo Progressives have seen the coming of the LHS as the opportunity they have been waiting for to create a new fairer and more just system for all. Noting that the old ideas of the past have marginalized various groups, they seek to uplift those in the lower classes to create a more equal society. Unlike their more revolutionary cousins however, Pro-Yagoo Progressives prefer to achieve this via reform with existing LHS institutions rather than tearing everything down to build a new perceived utopia.\n\nHowever, such a viewpoint is starting to lose steam as more revolutionary and populist movements are beginning to take root as the populace increasingly sees the more moderate and reformist policiesas not doing enough to solve the fundamental issues. In response, Pro-Yagoo Progressives have been forced to work with their former partisan opponents to present a united front against the radicals. Only time will tell whether or not  this will work.\n\nEven though the LHS may claim to be the defenders of liberty and democracy in the world, their members are not all uniformly democratic. Indeed, some reactionary politicians and Hololivers see the Hololivers as a sign of a higher power, and thus the resumption of a divine right to rule. While Pro-Yagoo Monarchists range from nominally constitutional to absolute, their governments are still illiberal in nature. However, they still cooperate with the LHS, whether they view the LHS leadership as similarly enlightened as their own or simply out of pragmatic national security interests.\n\nThe LHS on the other hand mostly view Pro-Yagoo Monarchists with suspicion, as their democratic credentials are debatable at best. They fear that the presence of monarchies within their ranks may undermine the message of the LHS as a force for democracy and peace. Nonetheless, the LHS still tolerates them as they provide a bulwark against the rise of more hostile ideologies; Resistance and Anti alike.\n\nThese groups are much more self-serving than ideological in nature, and for one reason or another, have found that cooperation with the LHS is the best way to get their agenda forward. Generally corrupt and often personalistic, these kleptocrats will stop at nothing to maintain their hold on power.\n"

ideology_summary_resistance_ideology: "A spectre is haunting the world; the spectre of revolutionaries. Birthed from Marxist theory, Pro-Resistance Revolutionaries believed that a radical restructuring of society must occur towards the proletariat against  the bourgeois classes. They view the founding of the LHS as just another plot by the ruling classes to maintain their hold on power while continuing to oppress the working class.\n\nThey have found an ally in similarly-disatisfied Hololivers, who seek to provide an alternative to the Yagooist order. Many of said Hololivers feel the same way, viewing the founding of the LHS as a betrayal of the populist rhetoric that got many of them into power. They vow that, as long as they draw breath, the workers of the world must unite to overthrow such systems to finally achieve peace for the underprivileged.\n\nPro-Resistance Nationalists are jingoists, who always place their country first. They see the degeneration of the LHS and they resolve to protect their nation from it. While they still believe in Hololiver leadership, they view them as a way to benefit the nation first rather than serving a global elite.\n\nThis world view is extremely similar to their Revolutionary counterparts, but if one was to mention this to a Resistance Nationalist, they would scoff and deflect any such relation. "The Revolutionaries are too idealistic!" "Their efforts to bring an international revolution will only be met with failure at the hands of the LHS!" "Better to focus on one nation and to build it up so that they may truly vanquish the forces of capital on the world!" Despite these differences, they are still willing to form a united front against the globalist tendrils of the LHS.\n\nHow can one come to terms with the divine right of Hololivers in conjunction with their grassroots populist support? According to Resistance Monarchists, they believe that the Hololiver can fulfill both these roles at the same time. By combining the best of both reaction and revolution, they hope to fulfill such a perfect system.\n\nJust like the other Resistance ideologies, Pro-Resistance Monarchism also holds many deep suspicions over the true goals and beliefs of Yagoo"s LHS system. However, while the others talk about working-class or national solidarity, Pro-Resistance Monarchists are more focused on venerating the Hololiver itself. Only then will the people"s long-sought out needs be finally satiated.\n\nThese groups are much more self-serving than ideological in nature, and for one reason or another, have found that cooperation with the Resistance is the best way to get their agenda forward. Generally corrupt and often personalistic, these kleptocrats will stop at nothing to maintain their hold on power."

ideology_summary_anti_ideology: "Some nationalists do not consider the existence of Hololivers enough to fully address a nation"s problems. Viewing Hololivers as just another force seeking to take their country down, these idealogues represent a new, much more radical form of nationalism, centralized around its leaders and committed against all of its perceived enemies, no matter what they are.\n\nWhile one may assume New Nationalism and Resistance Nationalism as ideological brothers, they have no love for each other. Similarly, their relations with other Resistance ideologies are also hostile, as they see all of them as sellouts to the Hololivers. They even have shaky relations with other Antis, only cooperating them in the short-term to fight against the Hololivers before likely turning on them for further control. They view all of these as aloof at best and traitorous degenerates at worst, equally as bad as the Hololivers they claim to fight against. They therefore seek to eventually cleanse all opposing influence to maintain a united resolve for the nation.\n\nMankind is meant to be equal and free from the shackles of government tyranny, and yet all throughout history has mankind found itself under these boots. From the kings of old to the dictators of today, a new force has arrived only to also prove itself to be one of the tyrants dressed in saviour"s clothing; the Hololivers. While many of them claim to be for democracy, democratic revitalizationists inherently distrust them due to their common flirtations of autocracy that announced their wake.\n\nDemocratic revitalizationists are diverse, ranging from normal liberals who just want to curtail the influence of the LHS to radical anarcho-capitalists who seek to tear down any oppressive state structure to usher in true market freedom. But all of them have a shared dream, that the tree of liberty may finally be planted, no matter how many tyrants have to fall to get that to happen. \n\nA spectre is haunting the world; the spectre of revolutionaries. And from the writings of figures such as Marx and Kropotkin a new red wave has swept in from the left. Calling for the means of production to be seized back to the workers who produced it, and the abolition of bourgeois structures that constantly oppress the worker, the radical left-wing has swelled in popularity with its promises of peace, bread, and equality for all.\n\nUnlike the revolutionaries that break bread with the Resistance however, some radicals view the Hololivers as a threat to the promised utopia. After all, don"t they also enrich themselves and their cronies to reap the benefits of their rule while the proletariat languish and starve? They especially hold grievances to the LHS - yet another structure made to enrich the global ruling class. The Hololivers have proved where their true loyalties lie; now it is time for the people to strike back.\n\nThe Enlightenment and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. The ancient royal houses have had their divine right to rule stripped away in favour of degeneration by the masses. At least, this is what Reactionary Monarchists think. The most reactionary of the reactionaries, they long for the return of the pre-Enlightenment era when absolutism in accordance with Heaven"s grace made a ruler instead of the common rabble.\n\nWhile a lot of monarchists welcome the Hololivers, viewing their appearance as proof that they have the divine right to rule, these reactionaries distrust them. They doubt the Hololivers, even the more autocratic-leaning ones, will truly return life to how it used to be. Only absolutism by true royal blood can save the country, finally righting past wrongs.\n"

ideology_summary_neutral_ideology: "Is there any purer love than love for one"s country? Ever since the revolutions and counter-revolutions of the late-18th to early-19th century, the idea that states should be constructed around a national identity has firmly implanted itself, with adherents stretching throughout the world. Seeking brotherhood with their compatriots in foreign lands, reactionary nationalist strive to have their nation be made fully whole, adopting revanchist policies to take back lost territories and reunite their long cast-off brothers.\n\nUnlike New Nationalists however, Reactionary Nationalists aren"t uniformly opposed to the existence of Hololivers, instead adopting a more neutral approach. After all, if the Hololiver helps in realizing their dream of national fraternity, why should they be opposed? While they still dislike the internationalist dreams of more idealistic Hololivers and the LHS system, they will still align with more statist Hololivers if they share the same national dreams.\n\nThere are those in politics that stick to their ideals. They always seek one worldview, base their ideology in that worldview, and carry out the tenets of that worldview. Of course, the world rarely works like such, according to mixed-ideology democrats. No matter whether they are socialist, conservative, or liberal, mixed-ideology democrats champion pragmatism as the main goal. Composed as a 'big tent" faction, they all share the same love for the country they live in, and thus feel the need for dialogue with one another rather than quarrelling and degenerating into partisan politics.\n\nFollowers of this philosophy present themselves as a fourth way between LHS, Resistance, and Anti forces. Emphasizing the need for neutrality, they will do what they think is best, and align themselves with whomever seems to benefit the country the most. Of course the question of what happens if the varying factions of a mixed-ideology democracy start disagreeing with each other pops up, due to the broad-front nature of the group. Nevertheless, those who agree with this philosophy still assert that, even though they may have their disagreements, pragmatism and the common national interest will still ultimately prevail.\n\nThe origins of the Hololivers are shrouded in great mystery. Some consider them to be just ordinary folk that just slipped through the cracks before finally shining through, while others consider them chosen by a greater purpose to lead their nation to destiny. But of course there are those that view the Hololivers themselves as otherworldly; a being that should be held in higher regard than their subjects before them. These are the followers of the Divine Mandate, who seek to build a national faith over the Hololiver based on their divine nature.\n\nSuch a situation could mean that the Hololiver in question can now be empowered to move beyond the traditional LHS-Resistance divide. It also compels them to build a highly personalistic, highly moralistic, and (often times) highly nationalistic regime as they start to think of a more independent foreign policy to go down towards; one that befits godly figures more than figures of mankind.\n\nThese groups are much more self-serving than ideological in nature, and for one reason or another, have found that neutrality between parties is the best way to get their agenda forward. Generally corrupt and often personalistic, these kleptocrats will stop at nothing to maintain their hold on power."

She had enlisted as a field army nurse for the British Colonial Army and tended to the hundreds of wounded at the Battle of Modder River. While as a nurse, she was also experimenting with plants, herbs, and chemicals to create remedies and concoctions. Her finest creation; "Watson's Concoction" proved to be highly effective and even more so when paired with certain medicines. By 1903, Amelia would be decorated with the Royal Red Cross and the Order of Merit later on in 1907. She would be wholeheartedly welcomed into Great Britain itself in 1904, from there she would meet notable British figures.\n\nArriving in Britain. Watson would continue her work in the medicinal field while also slowly dabbling into politics, especially regarding colonial affairs. Her comments on the subject matter earned her both fame and notoriety amongst the British Aristocracy. From 1906, Ame would join the upper class and establish a "gentleman's club" of her own known as the "Teammates Society". There they would discuss concurrent matters of the empire from both liberal and conservative perspectives. She would make speeches about the colonies, having experienced them first hand while also speaking for suffrage and free trade among other things. Although she wasn"t allowed to be a member of Parliament, Amelia had power to influence several of them and soon, many smaller Teammate Societies formed up from all across the isles. Often with unifying or contradicting ideals and ideologies. \n\nTensions would rise across Britain as the idea of revolution grows louder and louder from all social classes. The Irish lower class and the Ulster Teammates were more in favour of revolution as the latter were disillusioned with Yagooist ideals and British influence in Ireland was slowly waning. On the other hand, the upper classes elsewhere were either hesitant or against the idea, as the disorder and instability of a revolution would descend them into chaos. \n\nWhen the Great War began in 1912. The British government made measures to prevent strikes and demonstrations but 2 weeks later a riot broke out in Northern Ireland by Irish Republicans which led to the intervention of government and several paramilitary forces, including the Teammates. Reports of rising casualties and violence led to the British Army sending a fully armed battalion to replace and subdue the paramilitaries. In turn, Amelia would organise secret meetings with her Teammates in order to influence her upper class members for her own revolution, despite her contrary Yagooist views. Later on  in June 1912 when the Athens Revolt broke out, Draft dodging became more common and public opinion across Britain  plummeted to a low, deteriorating the stability and war effort of the country. At the Battle of Athens. British forces were being beaten back and surrendering in droves to the "Hololive Army". The situation at the homefront was not made any better as the creation of the British Home Guard and Public Order Authority, in order to suppress and contain any insurrectionists. This only inspired the Irish Republican Army and the Scottish National Movement to launch uprisings and demonstrations against the British government. \n\nThe world powers soon decided that the uprisings by the Hololive Revolutionaries were quickly destabilising their nations and decided that a ceasefire was needed in order to suppress these revolutionaries before hostilities could recommence. On May 1st, 1916, the Treaty of Verdun would be signed. Bringing the Great War to a sudden halt. It did not however put a halt to the dissatisfaction amongst the British Parliament as they argued whether or not to repeal the wartime acts."

WTS_tutorial_paths_background_pg2: "It all came to a head when on September 13th, Amelia Watson led the Teammates Revolution after months of careful planning. Organized militias were emerging from across Britain, seizing and besieging key cities. Loyalists and Counter-Revolutionaries also mobilised and made resistance movements against the Teammates while other revolutionaries emerged to claim their home territory from the Teammates. It had become an all out free-for-all for dominion over the whole British Isles. Hostilities would die down and finally cease in 1920 with Amelia Watson claiming the whole of Britain, Scotland, and Wales while most of Ireland was held by the Irish Liberation Army under Ceres Fauna.\n\nWhat emerged from the revolution was a Hololive kingdom with no monarch, Amelia as regent and nothing but ruins. Many of the towns and cities had been destroyed and depopulated as a result. Centuries of wealth had been wiped away in less than a decade and everything had to be rebuilt from the ground up. Measures were taken to speed up reconstruction, but it led to a  hyperinflation in 1924 where Watson had to seek assistance from other Hololive Nations. Unfortunately, the revolution also brought confusion and disillusion for many supporters. They were promised a golden age would come to Britain with someone like Amelia Watson at the helm but instead were left with the shattered remain of their once great homeland.\n\nDespite her best efforts, a "New Nationalist'' movement was forming in Scotland and parts of London in the late 1920s. In 1927, nearly half of the population in major industrial cities would have partaken in their movements. Further south, Amelia was seen as a puppet-master in Parliament however it couldn"t be proven by any LHS investigation. Elections would frequently result in National Teammate Front (NTF) victories, however their power and popularity had dwindled over the decade. They could not stand as a united front, but as a coalition of larger and smaller factions, such as the Royal Amelia League, Ulster Teammates, Workers" Alliance, and the Liberal Republicans. They divide themselves on whether or not Ameila should be crowned Queen of England, or reform Britain into a Hololive Republic. But to those who are either not in the NTF (whether the New Labour Movement or the Crown Party), or those not taking sides, they want Watson out of politics entirely.\n\nThe rise of "New Nationalists" led to more suppression and more resentment towards Amelia, especially since the Watson Secret Service was established as a way to stop the rising dissent. On April 23rd, 1928, the New Nationalist Party, the "Society of English Patriots", were supposed to launch a coup after months of planning and preparation, but their leaders were immediately caught and the followers scattered. They went into hiding but continued to spread more propaganda leaflets and brought an increasing public distrust in Amelia"s government, worsening her economic, industrial, and social situation. In June 1931, an uprising emerged in Scotland after a garrison was raided. An army was sent to suppress them but was attacked by an large English guerilla force outside of Lancaster and was forced back, and surrendered in Manchester. It was now clear that Amelia was weakened and that now was the time for the Kingdoms of Scotland and England to proclaim independence and for the Republic of Ireland to reunite. What resulted was a bloody war of attrition that neither could win, With support from other LHS nations, Amelia and her Ulster Teammates managed to retake Northern Ireland but couldn"t take Manchester and anything further north. Realizing that neither side can go on, both sides agreed to the Easter Accords in 1936. Although hostilities may have ended, both sides are biding their time and preparing for the next war."

NOE_tutorial_paths_background: "After the Treaty of Brugg, Noel was established as the Queen of Pomeranians and Prussians and following this designation of power, the Novo Feudom ( New Feudalism ) was enacted. This system propped up the nobility and gave them considerable wealth and power but were finally regulated by the Danzig Decree signed in 1922.\n\nFollowing the Danzig Decree came the Königsberg Accords which further tightened regulations and strengthened Noel and her party's, ON (Orden von Noel), power over the territories. Things get worse when the Elbing Trials occurred in 1925, where many noblemen were trialed for poor treatment of peasants and labourers. Growing discontent from the nobility would reach the final point in 1929 when Noel tried to force a bill through that would put an end to Novo Feudom. The officer class and their supporters deserted, removed ON from power and diminished Noel's role in the government to a mere figurehead.\n\nAnti ideologies quickly began to spread in the country during the Great Scare but their parties were swiftly banned and leaders were arrested in a bill universally supported by the dominant factions who wished to stay in charge.\n\nIn 1932 war was declared on the Polish State over a border incident, and the representative of the Uradel Faction infamously proclaimed Noel the Empress of Germans and Poles. However, this action resulted in Fubuki intervening in the war against Noel in order to retain dominance in the region; this war was then dubbed the Great Northern War. Fubuki's forces failed to deal any significant blow to Noel's army and soon on the defensive as Noel's forces began their offensive. However, Yagoo stopped and forced an armistice between the two, keeping the status quo. This was seen as a great victory for Noel and an utter embarrassment to Fubuki.\n\nIndustry struggled under Neo Feudom as the 'Eroberer' class, German and Baltic nobles granted lands from the Polish war of 1932, continued highly agrarian policies and the institution of serfdom that trapped many peasants on the estates and had stalled the process of urbanization which in turn slowed industrial development. However, urbanization exploded after the Great Depression where free farmers and peasants alike abandoned estates en masse and roamed the cities for work, the noblemen could do very little to keep them on the estates.\n\nNoel was hit hard by the Great Depression and the drop in demand led to a slump in agricultural prices and a catastrophic blow to the free farming class who were now leaning towards Anti parties who seek an end to the Novo Feudom and the nobility as a whole. This led to massive support for the 1935 Polish Rebellion which initally started from Flare's territories. Noel must manoeuvre herself through these crises to either take a backseat to the technocratic-military class, or to take charge and finally put an end to the experiment once and for all."

SUI_tutorial_paths_background: "The Bandit Empress\NSuisei had been discontent with the way of life under the Yagooist ideal and for the most part operated isolated from other Hololive members. From 1905 to 1907, Suisei had been living a double life where she would sing during the day and burglarize homes during the night. She was imprisoned, released in 1910, and continued the exact same life but this time with a gang until the Great War. She signed up as an army nurse for the French Army but soon discharged from duty as she was deemed to be 'too intimidating' as a nurse. Suisei was an incredibly charismatic figure and in 1914 she formed her own paramilitary organisation. Her membership only grew once the ceasefire between the Entente and the Central Powers was signed in 1916 and disgruntled veterans flocked to her in droves. The French government saw her and her organisation as a threat and ordered her arrest. Upon receiving this news, she revolted against the government on May 19th, dubbed as the 'Hoshiyomi Revolution'.\n\nFrench Instability\nOnce news of the Hoshiyomi Revolution broke out, the French military under command of Louis Franchet d'Éspérey overthrew the government and declared martial law. The initial plan was to reinstate the Bourbon Dynasty in France but large sections of the already demobilized army mutinied and strikes evolved into a new French Revolution, declaring themselves the 'French Socialist Revolutionary Republic'. During this chaos, the more organised Suisei forces (with assistance from Miko and Pekora) overwhelmed the armies in the region and by 1917 had controlled most of France. She was crowned later that year as Empress of France much to the dismay of republicans and radicals.\n\nThe 1919 Revolution\nPrior to 1922, Suisei had absolute rule over France and there was little hope that democracy would ever be restored bureaucratically. In a last ditch attempt to restore the French Republic, Joseph Gallieni along with various other Republicans declared the Paris Republic and called for another set of revolts against the perceived threat of tyranny. The Revolution spread like wildfire and by early 1920, Suisei had been deposed as Empress and had fled to Italy. However, before a constitution could be determined, Operation Comet was rolled into action by the coalition of Subaru, Kiara, Watson, Miko and Pekora. The operation was a massive success for the coalition who easily crushed any resistance in the span of only 2 months. The impacts of the 1919 Revolution were one of the main issues of the Geneva Protocols and had firmly established democracy, freedom of the press and freedom of demonstration as core Hololive values in order to prevent such a revolt from occuring again. It was decided that France was to be split into the Fourth Republic in the North and the Suisei Kingdom in the South. Various departments were to remain occupied due to strong security concerns."

SUI_tutorial_paths_background_pg2: "1920-1927 - The Conservative Revival\nIn the early years of post-Brugg France, there was an active emigration away from the pro-Hololive south into the Fourth Republic in the North, mostly amongst opposition groups. As a result of this, the support for the traditional French parties collapsed as conservative factions held an 8 year long majority in the lower house and in municipalities. Suisei still had her royal influence albeit limited, serving only as a figurehead. During this time as well, the ideas of Hololive Idealism and pacifism were still very popular especially amongst the political elite such as Jean Fabry who consistently retained his seat. This period was one of stability and relative calm in comparison to the previous decade. The closest thing to a scandal was the creation of the SJS, Youth Society for Suisei, which was prompted by an investigation into the intent of the organisation's creation. This changed with the rise of the CUT and the creation of the LHS. \n\n6 Years of the CUT (Coalition Uni de Travailleurs)\nAfter the economic fallout that came with joining the LHS, many had become dissatisfied with the status quo. Many former politicians of the Fourth Republic defected to the shockingly more stable south. Labour movements also began to take hold of the country, increasingly more discontent with laissez-faire capitalism. It boiled over in 1928 with the most contentious elections in years. Shortly after the CUT had declared victory, Suisei had sent a proposition to Jean Fabry and other Loyalists, stating her renewed interest in current affairs and her desire to regain some of her old royal powers.\n\nThe first term of CUT rule had been incredibly popular, protectionism had been reinstated, they had pulled out of the LHS, and steps were being taken to establish the Suisei south as an independent regime, this went as far as supporting Pekora in the Peko-Yagoo War. A move which would prove to be one of the fatal blows for the CUT. In 1931, the party was expected to deal with the Great Scare in a way that would lead to a quick recovery. Though what happened was the complete opposite as inflation continued to rise, unemployment exploded and many firms (including government ones) declared bankruptcy. It was through these failures that their rule was contested in the 1932 election. With all odds stacked against it, the CUT still managed to pull through with a minority government. However, this proved to be fatal to the party as every piece of legislation was boycotted by the growing 'Front National'. By 1934, the government had almost entirely collapsed and for the first time of her rule, Suisei had called a vote of no confidence against the CUT. Evidently, the CUT lost the vote and new elections were called by the senate in the month following. In this election, the FN won a plurality of the votes."

FBK_tutorial_paths_background: "A New Identity\nFubuki arrived in Northern Finland in 1901 confused, alone and misunderstood. She had trouble learning Finnish (although had an easier time with German and English) and the traditional society of Northern Finland had seen her just as any other woman. 'I can't live a life like this' she thought; she was always used to constant proposals and flowery words in the present, the cold shoulder was simply something she hadn't gotten before. So one day she decided to turn a new leaf. She was no longer Shirakami Fubuki, she was now Carl Ludwig von Ferson! A (male) Baltic-German noble, born and raised in Riga but had moved to Finland to experience life in an alien land. Under this new identity and behaviour, she quickly became more acquainted with the locals and got herself involved within the Svecoman Movement, who taught her Swedish and allowed her to meet notable Suecophiles within the Finish upper class and clergy.\n\nA New Life in the Army\nWhile Fubuki certainly became more popular within the Finish sphere, she still felt that she needed to explore the world and through word of Finish nobles, had heard of the constant demand of officers within the Russian Army so decided to take the train to St. Petersburg to enroll in a military academy and in 1904 graduated as a Second Lieutenant.. Expecting an easier time in the military, the events in the next 3 years greatly shaped her future. In 1905, she fought at Mukden and was promoted to Lieutenant for her service. In that same year she fought against the Russian Revolutionaries and became disdained by socialists and social democrats across the Empire because of this. Finally she was deployed to Persia to enforce Russian interests in the region. For these engagements she was promoted to Polkovnik. This had also granted Fubuki official status of nobility within Imperial Russia. In 1908 she enrolled in the General Staff Academy and graduated in 1910; being deployed in Finland to keep the peace in the region. Due to her long time in service and education, in 1911 she was promoted to General-mayor.\nWhen the Great War broke out in 1912, Fubuki was immediately called to the frontlines due to her experience and was attached to the Southwestern Front where she fought in the Battle of Galicia. However, after the Germans and Austrians began pushing the Russian army back in 1914, Fubuki suffered a string of losses and resigned from the army out of shame.\n\nA Return to Finland\nFubuki returned to Finland to mixed reception. On one hand the conservatives and nobility were proud of such a general to represent Finland in the Russian Army and on the other, the social democrats despised her for it. She returned to more or less civilian life, during this time until 1916, she read the works of various works of the Hololivers and began pushing for Finnish independence under Suecophile rule. Many had already been pushing for independence however, and as the Rushian Revolution began in mid-1916, Finland under Svinhufvud's Senate had declared an independent Republic. Mannerheim had returned to Finland during this time. It was only a month later in September that the Finnish Civil War broke out. Fubuki immediately organised the Suecophile militias under the banner of the white army. After successfully repelling the Red offensives, she assisted in the counter-attack that shattered the Red Army and forced its ringleaders to surrender. The War had yet to be finished however, as conflict between the German trained Jagers and Fennomans and the Suecophiles broke out. This was due to the Fennomans suspicion of white leader Mannerheim and Fubuki who both came from Swedish and Imperial Russian Military background Although the Jagers were well trained under the Germans, they still failed to properly lead the other Fennoman armies which lacked the same organisation as the Suecophiles. By December of 1916, the Fennomans had been defeated and the new pro-Swedish government in Finland had announced its intention to unite with Sweden. Fubuki (still known as Carl Ludwig von Ferson) was appointed as Head of the Demissionary Government while Mannerheim was given the role of Regent and Head of the Army due to his stronger Swedish background. Fubuki was promoted to Field Marshall for her role in the revolutionary war."

FBK_tutorial_paths_background_pg2: "Although most of the army had defected, the King's government had the White Fox Army which although 5 times smaller than the Republican forces, had much better equipment, more experience and were better trained. They also had the assistance from Mannerheim's government in Finland once the Helsinki Revolution was quelled. This culminated in the year and a half long war where Fubuki personally led the WFA and other pro-monarchist groups against the Republicans. In the Rikstad, the conservatives and even the King herself were extremely worried of the present events and considered removing Fubuki as Prime Minister. However,upon hearing the cries for their heads on the streets below, they decided against it. By early 1920 the WFA reached Oslo and the Storting fled to the Netherlands. In August, a naval invasion had taken place in Denmark and the government and King surrendered with the Danish fleet and fled to the Netherlands.\nFollowing this surrender, Fubuki led the reorganisation of the newly conquered territories. Firstly, establishing the King of Sweden as the Kings of Norway, Finland, Denmark and Iceland to keep the royalists on her side. This also extended the King's powers to these regions. Secondly, regional governments with a democratically elected 'First Minister' were set up in order to give a guise of federation rather than Swedish imperialism. These 'First Ministers' however, would have limited power in comparison to the 'Governor-Generals' which were appointed by the King and were almost always members of the White Fox Army.\n\nThe Puppet Government\nDespite being a democracy in name, the country was effectively a dictatorship whose powers lay within Fubuki. The ruling conservatives and liberals mostly opposed her in secret as speaking out against her ran the risk of Fubuki calling in the King to deal with the matter; which at this time was defeatist in his approach and had largely given up trying to oppose her. An individual MP speaking out would also most likely lead to him being disavowed by the rest of his party who don't want to be associated with a dissenting voice (although they may disapprove themselves). This led to a situation where the country ran off of sheer dread, everything was done in Fubuki's approval and nothing was done without it.\n\nFubuki During the 1920s\nFubuki stood at the Treaty of Brugg as a misfit. While most other members had been behind the curtains revolutionaries or simply attached themselves to a revolution, Fubuki had overthrew and bent the will of numerous countries and powerful people through will and had an illustrious military career. Even as she gained and continued to maintain power, she kept up the persona of Carl Ludwig von Ferson as a simple means of legitimizing her rule; although most other Holomembers saw through this at Brugg. Despite this however, she was still a quiet, soft-spoken leader who became known for having strange obsessions and hobbies. During the 20s she had drawn a slew of comics under an anonymous pen name and had a notable gambling addiction. She was also infamous amongst her ministers for having an obsession with eyewear. These odd quirks were by no means undermining elements of her regime as her base slowly began to shift.\nAlthough infamous for her actions during the Russian Revolution of 1905, the Finnish Civil War and the Swedish Revolution. The decade prior to the Great Northern War was one of great progress for the lower class as further job opportunities in mining, industry and construction opened up. In addition to this was the adoption of welfare programs and grants that massively increased government spending. By 1927, the approval rating of Fubuki had greatly improved amongst the working class. In that same year, Fubuki joined the LHS and was one of the main beneficiaries of the free trade agreements. Lumber based, and mining based industries grew dramatically due to new access to regional markets. Despite being a major player within the LHS, she was not popular amongst the organisation's democratic members although some did think that joining the LHS was a sign of reform. She was also lauded by the likes of Suisei and Miko. In 1928, news arose of a plot against Fubuki within the ranks of the army and the parliament. Thus, under advice from loyalist Helge Jung, she issued a purge within the ranks. Over the span of 4 months, 60% of the officers, 4 Major Generals, 6 Lt. Generals and a quarter of the General Staff were removed from their position and placed under house arrest. On the political side, the most prominent figure purged was Kyosti Kallio who was removed under order of the King. These purges were carried out by the Committee for National Security and Intelligence (CNSI) of which Fubuki herself was head of. These purges and the foundation of the CNSI laid the path for what was to come."

FBK_tutorial_paths_background_pg3: "The Great Northern War\nBackground and Reasons for Intervention\nThe Great Northern War occured in 1932 shortly after Noel's coronation as Kaiserin of all Germans. It initially only took place between Kronii and Noel but after an LHS telegram, Fubuki decided to mobilise against Noel. After one month, Fubuki invaded the Baltic Territories. Fubuki was the only nation to do this however, as other nations such as Flare and Rushia declined; and others such as Kiara and Subaru did not get access through Germany or Czechoslovakia. The reasons for joining however spanned much more than just doing a simple favour for Yagoo.\nOptics were a very good reason for the intervention, while both Kronii and Noel had long lost their good favour with the Yagooists, Fubuki was simply a sore spot who had technically come to power in Sweden through Yagooism but had failed to live up to any of their other ideals. Thus, supporting a side which was backed by the LHS was going to boost the view of her within the organisation. It would also ensure that Fubuki would have political leverage in case the LHS considered sanctioning her.\nMilitary experience was another major reason. With a large portion of officers and generals being purged, younger officers would need to have hands-on experience in order to continue Fubuki's military superiority over the continent. It was also an opportunity to test out major breakthrough technologies such as light tanks and tankettes, new fighters and bombers, new small arms and much more.\nFinally, wanting to assert Fubuki dominance over the region was necessary considering the buildup of other regional powers. Most of continental Europe had begun their rearmament programs and passed laws for conscription. Fubuki on the other hand was facing a stagnating economy and faced a major manpower shortage. Thus, an invasion of a foreign country would revitalise confidence amongst Scandinavians and remind the world of Fubuki's glory.\nWhat was important to note was that much of the army remained at home or in Russia to suppress dissent. Out of 7 army groups and 48 divisions at the start of the war, only the White Fox Army with 7 divisions (6 infantry, 1 cavalry ) and the Experimental Leichter Kampfwagen Army ( 2 tank divisions, 2 motorised ) was utilised during the majority of the invasion. The W.F Marines and 3 infantry divisions from the Finland Guard were transferred to the invasion force during the span of the war however. Noel on the other hand was able to field over 20 divisions ( a majority of which were infantry and cavalry) in the Northern Front alone. This was more of a logistical issue rather than a tactical misplay. The W.F Navy and Airforce were vital to the operation\n\nMonths of Hell\nThe early stages of the invasion went extremely well for Fubuki as the well armed, well equipped White Fox Army pushed through Estonia and Latvia easily, with most of Noel's troops there fleeing southwards or being held POWs. There were only minor pockets of resistance in the major urban centres and the wetlands and forested regions. Things began to turn for the worse once they reached Lithuania, where the White Fox Army faced heavy losses in the Žemaičiai and the Baltic Highlands. However, the assault continued until they reached the Nemunas River and the Neris Tributary where everything ground to a halt. Noel's troops had by this time dug in behind the rivers and had destroyed the bridges. This left the conventional options of either attacking the cities of Vilnius and Kaunas or attempting to cross the river. Shelling of the two cities began immediately. Under Brigadier Erkki Raappana, the 23rd Arctic Fox Regiment began the Memel offensive to moderate success. An attempt to cross the river into Kaišiadorys was made but a steadfast defence repelled the attackers. Similar stories continued for weeks until finally, Erik Heinrichs proposed the utilisation of a naval invasion at the towns of Pillau, Cranz and various points in between to secure a foothold.\nAlthough the initial landing was successful with mild losses due to the conditions, the attempt to connect the beaches together failed miserably as the 2nd Panzer Division was stationed neighby at Königsberg and quickly crushed the marines. The majority of those who landed were captured or killed. It was after this failed invasion and pressure from the LHS, that Fubuki and Noel reached a ceasefire by November of 1932.\n\nThe Home Front and the proclamation of the Empire\nWhile the invasion took its course in the Baltics, Fubuki gradually took more official powers in parliament. She curtailed the power of parliament and granted herself 'emergency' powers. She also took direct control of various important parts of the country such as the Armed Forces and the police. Once the ceasefire was signed and the powers given to her were supposed to be revoked, Fubuki instead dissolved parliament (Arresting the notable critics) and declared King Gustav V a traitor in his own Kingdom. Once the King finally tried to remove her as PM, it was much too late as he was quickly placed under House Arrest. The next day, in an extremely controversial move, Fubuki crowned herself as Empress of Scandinavia, the Baltics and Finland; surprisingly to the applause of her citizens.\n\nThe Eastern Oblasts\nOne of the remnants of the previous regime was the Oblast system meant to organise Fubuki's Russian lands. This quickly showed its flaws however as corrupt local officials pocketed much of the money or funnelled it to Anti groups in the area.\n\nThe Kronii Oblast\nThe Kronii Oblast had come into existence shortly after agreeing to leave Moscow with her followers. Fubuki agreed to take them in under the St. Petersburg Accords which allowed Kronii to manage one of the most eastern oblasts along the Ural Mountains. Although this was done reluctantly, Fubuki and Kronii had got along well prior to the Great War and didn't believe that she'd attempt to undermine her power in the region."


GAW_tutorial_paths_background: "Gura's beginnings in the time warp have been rather easy going but lonely. She was separated from her genmates upon arrival, having no contact with any of them other than Calli via telegram, who was in California. She began her life in the old world working as a farmhand in rural Utah on a small ranch. She worked the days away, living an honest farmer's life and eventually made enough to have her own small ranch where she grew wheat, seasonal vegetables and a herd of farm animals. While she was satisfied with living the simple life, she couldn't help but miss her former life with her genmates, particularly Amelia. One day, an agent of Yagoo came to Gura's ranch and informed her of some breaking news; war had broken out in Europe and the Hololive revolutions had begun. Gura was hesitant to leave her farmer's life but once she heard of Ame and Kiara's taking part in the revolution, she sold her ranch and packed her bags for Europe.\n\nArriving in Great Britain, Gura met with Ame again for the first time in a decade and helped Ame lead the revolution in Britain, ousting the British government. Arriving in continental Europe to aid the rest of the revolutionaries, Gura met up with Ina who was a travelling artist in France, and eventually Kiara who was part of the Bavarian Revolution. After the war ended, the genmates met up with Calli at Brugg for the signing of the treaty. Their reunion was to be short however, as trouble brewed in the East; Yagoo called upon Gura and Ina to fill the vacuum of HoloCN in China. Gura packed her bags with Ina and said goodbye to the rest of her genmates once again. The arrival of the second wave of Hololivers was a massive shakeup in Chinese politics. Gura was assigned to the troubled region of Mainland China by Yagoo in 1927 to clean up the collapsing Hololive China regime. A land plagued with corruption, poverty, political instability and bloodthirsty warlords, it was a great mountain of a challenge for our shark to overcome. Nevertheless, this small shark would bring China under her heel.\n\nGura arrived in Taiyuan in early 1927, welcomed in open arms by the trusting Yogiri. Gura understood the dire straits that Hololive Revolution in the East was currently in; the members of the China branch refused to cooperate with each other and faced external threat of resurgent warlords and the Kuomintang, not to mention the ever advancing Japanese Army that was sweeping across Easern and Central China. Gura sent a telegram to Civia and Artia, currently holding out in their respective Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, calling for a conference in Taiyuan to discuss a reconciliation of all Hololive forces in China. She dominated the Taiyuan Conference through powerful speechcraft and a hard leverage of fresh LHS funds and arms. It was agreed that under Gura's tutelage that the New United Hololive Front was to be formed; all existing troops of the Hololive China members would be merged into a unified army with Gura serving as field marshall and Hololive China members remaining generals of their respective forces. In addition to the standing armies of the Hololive China members, Gura started a militia initiative called the Shrimps who served as both combat units and an auxiliary corps that performed a variety of tasks such as reconstruction, backline production, and policing. With superior LHS funding and the encouragement from the charismatic Gura, the Shrimps swelled in numbers and formed both the frontline and backbone of the United Hololive Front.\n\nOne of the first objectives of the United Hololive Front was to liberate the besieged Rosalyn on Hainan Island. In comparison to the Kuomintang and warlord forces, the Japanese were stretched rather thin and thus could be exploited on individual fronts easier. They held the line at the center against Kuomintang and warlord forces while Yogiri's mountain forts in Shanxi bogged down the Japanese. The united army then concentrated a force down South in Guangxi province and launched a bold offensive. At the same time, utilizing the LHS liaison agents, Gura was able to get into contact with Echo, currently in hiding with her ring of Triad gangs. Gura notified Echo that reinforcements were on the way and convinced her Triads to run a distraction operation through terror bombings, railway sabotage and assassination attempts to draw away Japanese forces from the southern line. With the Japanese rearline in Fujian distracted by the surge of Triad attacks, the thinning frontline was broken. The United Hololive Front liberated Rosalyn's forces and retook Guangxi and Guangdong provinces along with sections of Fujian. They then reorganized their forces in the South to incorporate Rosalyn's army and sections of Echo's Triads. The paltry Japanese garrisons in Hong Kong and Macau were besieged and slowly starved out."

GAW_tutorial_paths_background_pg2: "With the South secure and the Japanese army in the region in retreat, the Hololive forces retook Fujian and incorporated the Echo Triads, then drew out a plan for a general advance North towards the central plains where the primary opponent was the Kuomintang and various warlords who all struck an uneasy coalition in the face of the Japanese invasion. Gura knew that if she was able to take over the face of Chinese resistance against the Japanese, Hololive would gain a propaganda victory that would bring more Chinese under Hololive control and bolster their ranks. Knowing of their fragile alliance, Gura reached out to warlords who were likely on the short end of the alliance such as Wu Peifu and Sun Chuanfang, both Zhili warlords who weren't particularly satisfied being led by Chiang Kai-Shek and his Kuomintang. These men were convinced to switch sides through both methods of bribery and promises of high positions in government post-war. She also contacted more corrupt warlords such as the likes of Zhang Zongchang, who was easy to bribe with LHS capital. Gura laid out the plan for the warlords to break off their alliance with the Kuomintang as the Hololive United Front marched north. At the same time, a pincer attack was performed by Yogiri from the North in Shanxi and a push from Sichuan by Civia. The Hololive army was able to link up with defecting warlord forces, effectively cutting off several pockets of NRA troops, many of whom surrendered. The Kuomintang's army had collapsed and Chiang Kai-Shek disappeared in the chaos; Gura granted amnesty to the surrendering Kuomintang troops and officers, offering them a chance to fight again for China under Gura's Shrimps. With the Kuomintang down and large portions of their military incorporated into the Shrimps, Gura and Hololive forces took over the Kuomintang as the face of Chinese resistance against the Japanese.\n\nAt the same time, Ina's Tentacult launched their uprising in Manchuria and disrupted Japanese lines to prevent an effective Japanese offensive during Gura's move against the Kuomintang. After the central plains were secure, Gura's United Front pushed North into Manchuria while a detachment force marched into Zhejiang province to subdue the remaining Japanese pocket by the coast. Most Japanese forces escaped to Shanghai to escape and those who didn't make it fought to the bitter end, most of which were killed or captured. Doris's remnants in Shandong came out of hiding and harassed Japanese garrisons in the province as the Hololive United Front advanced, eventually linking up with the main army. Ina's Tentacult had secured all of Manchuria and made a push into Korea while Gura's forces reached Hebei. Tianjin was quickly secured and cut off a majority of the Japanese forces in the region, who could not escape due to the Tentacult's presence. Similar to the situation in Shanghai, many Japanese fought to the bitter end of only a fraction surrendering. Those who surrendered largely surrendered to Ina's Tentacult who offered them spiritual amnesty.\n\nWith Ina's securing of Korea, Gura took a trip north to Shenyang in a secret meeting with Ina. The two wished to end the Japanese and incorporate them into their newly carved realms. In what is called the SameTako Agreement, Japanese holdings were split about evenly among Gura and Ina; Korea and Manchuria were to fall into Ina's tentacles while Gura took Taiwan and Okinawa. The Japanese Home Islands were agreed to be split among the 2; Gura taking the South and Ina taking the North. Despite the distrust of Ina by the Hololive China members due to her occultist nature and the fact that she was a newcomer, Gura convinced the United Front that her Tentacult was instrumental to the victory against the Japanese, and a final offensive on the Home Islands was needed to finally crushed the Japanese. Most of Gura's followers were thoroughly unconvinced and were satisfied with the liberation of mainland China, with only a handful of independent troops volunteering for the invasion of Japan. Gura's Shrimp and Ina's Tentacult scrounged together a paltry fleet, where Gura was able to procure a handful salvaged, outdated Beiyang Navy ships, while Ina captured 2 IJN destroyers (IJN Mochizuki and IJN Satsuki) and heavy cruiser IJN Ashigara. In addition, several hundred fishing boats and cargo ships were requisitioned as troop transport vessels. Gura's forces made a rushed and messy landing in Taiwan as the majority of the Japanese Navy was moving to defend the home islands. Knowing that time was not on her side, the fleet of makeshift transports dropped another several contingents off at the consecutive Okinawa Island chain. Fighting was heavy in Taihoku (Taipei) and on Okinawa Island as Gura's troops wrestled for control of the island territories and remained contested. Over in the Korean peninsula, Gura and Ina's combined fleet at Jeju Island sailed for Kyushu, attempting to avoid large concentrations of the IJN in an attempt to pick them apart in smaller detachments."

GAW_tutorial_paths_background_pg3: "The outgunned and outdated fleet made it as far as the coast off Nagasaki before superior IJN naval intelligence detected them. The battle of Nagasaki Bay that followed was more akin to a massacre than an actual battle; Gura's outdated Beiyang ships were sunk before they were able to engage a single Japanese ship, while the Tentacult captured Japanese ships performed poorly due to lack of crew training. The combined fleet made a hasty retreat back to Korea, with the captured Japanese vessels heavily damaged and over 10000 Shrimps and Tentacultists losing their lives after being sunk in their transports. Fortunately, due to Gura's capture of Taiwan and the Okinawan Islands, the battle of Nagasaki was able to be largely swept under the rug and Gura decided to sue for peace with the Japanese. The invasion of Japan had to be postponed in favour of securing the mainland.\n\nAll combat ceased on Taiwan and Okinawa as the Treaty of Okinawa was signed at Shuri Castle. Delegates from the LHS all the way from Europe arrived at the conference along with all Hololive China members, a handful of warlords, Chiang Kai-Shek and of course, Gura and Ina. Under the treaty's terms, Japan was to relinquish all of her territories from the mainland and Taiwan was to return to the Chinese sphere. Korea was to be relinquished and Okinawa was to be designated as a specially administered region under Gura's tutelage. After the Japanese relinquished control of their territories, the LHS East Asia System was to be established under guidance of the LHS.\n\nThe result of the Treaty of Okinawa was a stab in the back to the Hololive China members who participated in the war under Gura's lead. This did not matter to Gura however, who was now the paramount head of East Asia, controlling a majority of the Chinese mainland and Pacific territories. Additionally, her actions in the war garnered her a good reputation among the common Chinese people, former Kuomintang and swayed former Hololive China council followers, and even standing warlords. With a monopoly on military power and strong LHS funding, Gura consolidated power, forming a new party with Kuomintang defectors and loyalist warlords: the Guramintang. The new government took many cues from Sun Yat-Sen's Sanmin Principles to ease administration setup and build upon Chinese nationalism which also pleased the many Kuomintang defectors. Warlords who supported Gura were rewarded with control over military districts and were allowed to maintain private estates and lead their own armies, though they are now under direct command of the Shrimps. In the years following Gura's consolidation of power, China entered a period of growth and stability where her territory rapidly industrialized through LHS funding as well as the expansion of the Shrimps, whose membership grew exponentially through genuine support from the Chinese people. As the economy boomed and industry grew, Gura became the fastest industrializing nation in the LHS and the largest land army in East Asia. The rapid economic growth and high militarism began to generate a cult of personality surrounding Gura, especially among the Shrimp corps. There are many who wish for Gura to take on more authority and power based on her reputation and previous successes, suggesting the role of president for life or even a new empress for China; she certainly has the legitimacy for the Mandate of Heaven. However, hardline followers of Sun Yat-Sen's principles wish to maintain the republic with Hololive principles, especially under former Kuomintang politicians and warlords who want to retain their autonomy within Gura's state.\n\nThe Shrimp Corps remains the core of Gura's military and it is both a blessing and a curse. The sheer size of the corps deters any of her neighbours from invading, but they remain poorly trained in comparison to other warlord armies and the Japanese. Furthermore the sheer size eats up a substantial portion of the state's budget. To alleviate the problem of Gura's increasingly bloated and outdated military, she will have to reform the Shrimps into a professional army and integrate the autonomous armies of her various allied warlords which will both centralize the state and bring a fairly well trained pool of troops to the central army.\n\nOn the borders, the situation remains tense as years of industrialization and military buildup has created a powder keg in the East. All around Gura's borders, the Hololive China council members surround her, filled with anger and vengeance for her “betrayal” at the Treaty of Okinawa. Gura cannot take them down one at a time, as they have all agreed to a “containment” policy of Gura. At the same time, they cannot strike Gura individually or all at once at the moment due to the sheer size of the Shrimps holding well defended positions at the borders, along with their own backlines being threatened by other Holo States. Additionally, Japan remains a contemptuous foe at sea, waiting for the day to land on the shores of the mainland once again. In the far off islands of the North Philippines, her garrison is constantly tested by the ever expansionist Haachama. Gura obtained control of the Northern Philippine Islands in 1935 under an LHS peacekeeping mission to halt Haachama from gaining more land in the Pacific; the Philippine government was dismantled by both the LHS and Haachama and the islands remain in a tense, divided and occupied state to this day. With the abundance of enemies, Gura only has a handful of allies. She maintains cordial relations with Ina after the war and SameTako Agreement, so striking an official alliance would be to the best interests of Gura in both deterring threats on the mainland and perhaps one day finishing off Japan. Gura still maintains high favour with the LHS as the representative of their power in the East, giving her access to LHS capital. Internationally, Gura maintains communications with her fellow genmates in other parts of the globe and has recently expanded relations to South America, sending a detachment of Shrimps to serve in Shion's holding.\n\nGura's control of China and impeccable diplomacy has allowed her to become the fastest growing nation in the LHS. However, her mission is far from over as threats surround her from all sides. If Gura is to maintain her position in the Middle Kingdom, she must organize her assets and wait for the right opportunity to strike."
