OKA_okayu_nekomata_desc: "Nekomata Okayu is the current governor of Iran and co-hegemon of the Middle East, controlling Persia, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan. Like her counterpart Korone, she holds a modernist view for the Middle East, working to industrialize the region. Okayu's calm and collected personality keeps her subjects at ease and she knows how to diplomatically defuse tense situations. \n\nOkayu was one of the leaders of the Arab Revolt during the Great War and one of the heads of the Arabian theater of the Hololive Revolution, with the other head being Korone. Okayu was already embedded within Persian society, influencing the nobility from the inside. When news of the Hololive Revolution broke out, she linked up with Korone and moved her forces to secure the Middle East. She also secured Turkmenistan and Afghanistan post-Brugg, and works with Korone to develop the Middle East, expanding resource extraction and infrastructure.\n\nOkayu's reign is strong in Persia, she is currently threatened by the peoples of the border regions of her territory. The Turkmen tribes are not so happy to be under the rule of Okayu and by extension the Persians, while Afghanistan's tribes remain an ever difficult to control region for any empire. The Afghan tribes have conducted a guerrilla warfare campaign for at least a decade since the mid 1920s, and the remote region is a chore to control. Okayu's proximity to Matsuri keeps her uneasy as Matsuri is currently rebuilding her forces to take vengeance for the War of the Sands. Okayu must decide to maintain control and pacify the border regions of her lands or let go of these remote regions to have breathing room to combat the Matsuri threat."
