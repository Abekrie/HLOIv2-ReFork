FLA_flare_shiranui: "Shiranui Flare"
FLA_flare_shiranui_desc: "Flare was seemingly just another poor, starving peasant who lived alongside an equally poor and miserable family. Nevertheless, her new family helped her adapt to the peasant lifestyle. She soon grew tired and fed up with her living conditions. Under Yagooist principles, rising through society should be an easy feat but clearly something was wrong. Flare felt disillusioned by Yagoo and the lies that she thought he had told. By 1907, Flare began to involve herself with agrarian socialist groups. Soon, she amassed a sizable following amongst the Ukrainian peasantry and other ethnic minorities in the region. Seeing so much ethnic division and attempts of Russification, Flare attached herself to the idea of Ruthenian Nationalism; the revival of the old state of Ruthenia as a bulwark against Russia.\n\nWhen the Hololive Revolution began, Flare rose up alongside other socialist, anarchist and nationalist groups under a unified banner and slogan: “Democracy, Socialism and No More Tsars!”. During the early months of the revolution, she established connections with her old friend Noel. After the collapse of the German Army, Flare turned her attention Eastward towards the lands being torn apart by the Russian Revolution. Not long after the defeat of Soviet forces in Western Russia and the Treaty of Brugg, Flare turned her attention inwards. She saw the Anarchist armies, who refused to disarm, in particular as a threat to her power. Despite major public outcry, Flare underwent a long campaign to stomp out the Anarchists. By 1924, all the Anarchist movements had gone underground or fled the country entirely. With the country firmly within her grasp, she once again turned her focus abroad. Flare's ultimate priority was neutrality. Noel, Rushia, Fubuki and the recently formed LHS all competed in the region for dominance; Flare lay directly in the centre of attention. Soon, foreign money began flooding the Ruthenian State. Whatever wealth was brought to the country was only matched by the corruption, which soon spiralled out of control. This time of prosperity and decadence was smashed by the Great Scare, Great Northern War and Great Depression which brought the economy to its knees and the budget to a breaking point.\n\nFlare is growing ever more paranoid. She can't trust the LHS, Resistance, Noel or even her own cabinet. Even as Flare's stress has increased, more and more pressure has been placed on her by her neighbours to finally abandon her longtime stance of neutrality in an ever-polarising world. In 1935 she finally broke and joined the LHS. Despite this, the military government still remains albeit in a weakened, decrepit state. The economy still remains in ruins. Most critically, the people who Flare initially sought to save, have now turned their backs against her."
