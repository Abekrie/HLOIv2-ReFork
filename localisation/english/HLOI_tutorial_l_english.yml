lore_summary_content_loc: "Before the early 20th century the world was one much more familiar to us. Empires cast their shadow over much of the earth, and the global powers drew ever nearer to war. Then, as far back as 1899, a group of time travellers arrived. Led by their leader Yagoo, the members of the idol company Hololive strove to prevent The Great War from occurring and spread messages of world peace. However, rather than preventing The Great War, they inadvertently brought it upon the world much earlier. The existing order, fearing Hololive's influence, found an excuse when a paramilitary led by Pekora raided a Turkish garrison which was used as the justification to invade Serbia, kicking off the 1912 Balkan War. As The Entente tried to contain the Ottomans, the Central Powers entered the war on behalf of the Ottoman Empire. Due to their anti-war messages, the Hololivers became targets of harsh censorship from both The Entente and Central Powers. As a result, the Hololivers and their vast amounts of followers rose up and fought brutal uprisings, which brought one country after another to their knees. The fighting ceased in 1919 with the signing of the Treaty of Brugg, bringing an end to the war that Hololive travelled back in time to stop.\n \n In only a decade the world had drastically changed. Formerly vast and mighty empires were brought to their knees, their lands shattered and divided amongst the idols. These new Hololive states redrew the map and crudely imitated the nations that once stood before them. However, although the end of The Great War brought 10 years of brutal fighting to a stop, it did not bring an end to the chaos that Hololive had to contend with. In the final years of the war, disagreement arose between the idols as each laid claim to different territories, only to be disappointed when their claims were not satisfied in The Treaty of Brugg. This was coupled with a rise in worker's strikes, protests and partisan attacks in the wake of post-war economic collapse. They also questioned the original motive of global peace in favour of peace that they alone would dictate. To ensure further cooperation between the idols, and to further secure his influence, Yagoo formed the £lhs_texticon|1 League of Hololive States (L.H.S). Despite this, peace was merely a dream for Yagoo and his idols as sabre rattling, rebellions and civil unrest became the norm in place of compromise and negotiation. This internal chaos was followed by external tensions between the various idols. In 1930 due to resentment against Yagoo for not satisfying her territorial claims, Aqua and a number of other idols seceded from the L.H.S. Together they formed The Resistance, an organisation dedicated to usurping Yagoo's global influence.\n\n Now in 1936, the world is more divided than even before the Hololivers arrived. Yagoo attempts to maintain his global reach and keep his Idols in line, while Aqua's Resistance works to end his global hegemony and further influence the world on their own terms. At the same time various Anti-Hololive individuals plot to break their nations free from Hololive influence and return the former glory of their homelands. The future now lies in the hands of the Hololivers, who's promises of peace seem long forgotten."
