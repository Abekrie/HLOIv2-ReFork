SUI_minister_suisei:0 "Suisei"


SUI_hoshimachi_suisei_desc:0 "§CHoshimachi Suisei\nHead of State§!\nHoshimachi Suisei was crowned §PQueen of the French§! in §y1917§! and like many other Hololive rulers, operated with §Pabsolute power§! until the §yGeneva Protocols in 1920§! mandated §ldemocratization§! amongst all of its signatories. It was only until §y1922§! though that her §Proyal powers§! were drastically reduced to mere §Pemergency measures§! and new §Sregulation§! was passed to limit her influence in the new §lparliament§! in Marseille. These §Sregulations§! most notably included a bill forcing her to keep an §Papolitical stance§! on issues and restricted her ability to endorse political candidates. By §y1934§! however, blunder after blunder had plummeted the government's public support and §Mpolitical upheaval§! was at its highest point since the §yAnti-Hololive Spring of 1919§!. The subsequent result of this was that significantly more people became willing to overlook Suisei §Poverstepping her boundaries§! set by the then §Mabyssmally unpopular government.§!"

SUI_eduard_deladier_desc:0 "§CEduard Deladier\nFirst Minister§!\n§lPro-Yagoo Progressive§!\nPrior to the Great War, Éduard Daladier had staunchly rejected the notion of §dHololive Idealism§! and was confident that the belief would lead to the downfall of France. Upon the outbreak of the war, he was drafted into the French army and most notably fought in both the §yBattle of Orléans§! and §yParis§!;the last attempts of resistance by the Armée de Terre. Daladier however, did not participate in the §mAnti-Hololive Spring§! and by §y1921§!, chose to return into regional politics in the newly established §dFourth French Republic§!. His political career in the §dFourth Republic§! ended prematurely as the increasingly radical §SFrench Workers Party§! kicked him from the party and he failed to win popular support as an independent. Daladier then returned to the South of France and joined §lles Libérals-Conservatifs§! where he began to see political success, and in §y1933§!, became party leader. Following the collapsing support of the §DCUT§!, Daladier was the main figure in organizing the §lcentre-left 'Front National' coalition§! to topple the §DCUT§! and call snap elections in which the §lFN§! won a landslide victory."

SUI_camille_chautemps_desc:0 "§CCamille Chautemps\nMinister of the Interior§!\n§lPro-Yagoo Kleptocracy§!\nCamille Chautemps served as Mayor of Tours throughout the period of the §yGreat War§! and in the following years after §yBrugg§!, attempted to further his career in the §mFourth Republic§! but had failed to take off due to his lackluster, §destablishment§! rhetoric. After a series of defeats, he emmigrated to Lyon to restart his political career as a member of the §lLibérals-Conservatifs§! and championned himself as a §sman of the people§! who would work to empower the §lrepublican ideals of France§! against the backdrop of the §prestorationist atmosphere§! of the §y1920s§!. Upon the rise of the §DCUT§! after the formation of the §dLHS§!, he left the §lLC§! in hopes of landing a position in office and in §y1930§!, was appointed Deputy Prime Minister under §yJoseph Paul-Boncour§! until Chautemps once again, ditched the §DCUT§! in §y1931§! once the anti-§DCUT§! scandals were in full swing. Chautemps only narrowly got back into the §lLC§! and spent the following years rebuilding his image within the §lLC§! until he was appointed the position of Minister of the Interior after former minister §yAndré Tardieu§! passed away due to a stroke."

SUI_leon_blum_desc:0 "§CLéon Blum\nMinister of Finance§!\n§lPro-Yagoo Progressive§!\nLéon Blum had been a part of the §ymass emigration to Southern France§! after the §yTreaty of Brugg§! and continued to play a role in regional politics under the umbrella of the §DCUT§!. However, the §DCUT's§! turn towards §Dauthoritarian-populism§! in their rise to power caused Blum to leave the party and form the §lRepublican Socialists§! along with various other §lanti-authoritarian§! politicians. Despite the §lRS'§! lack of success in the §y1934 elections§!, they were viewed as being §lmoderate§! enough to be included in the §l'Front National' coalition§!. This platform gave Blum a significantly larger platform and soon after the former Finance Minister, §yCharles de Lasteyrie§!, resigned after suffering from a stroke, many of Blum's supporters in parliament lobbied for his appointment to the open office. Backed by support from the government and the §spopulace§!, Deladier appointed Blum to the post."

SUI_jean_fabry_desc:0 "§CJean Fabry\nMinister of the Armed Forces§!\n§cPro-Yagoo Conservative§!\nJean Fabry held the longest time in cabinet of any minister of Suisei's parliament §ypost-Brugg§!. Despite a notable career with the Armée de Terre, he was crippled in the first months of fighting against the Germans in the Great War and took an NCO role until the surrender of the §mThird Republic§! in §y1917§!. After the surrender, he temporarily worked as a newspaper writer which encouraged supporting the Suisei regime and was a part of the French representation (§mas many other senior officers and generals declined§!) in the §yGeneva Agreement§!. Fabry then entered the political sphere as part of the minorty which still believed §yHololive Idealism§! could still be achieved after the §yGeneva Protocols§!. His commitment to §yHololive Idealism§! was only proven in his major involvement with the §yOMGP§!§ §y(Organisation for the Maintenance of the Geneva Protocols)§! which pushed for limited national armament. He ran as an independent minister representing one of the constituencies of Aveyron, winning his seat each time and being appointed to Minister of the Armed Forces; even during the 6 year rule of the CUT. Despite his military background, Fabry unorthodoxly supports détente and was cited for the main reason for the decadence in the Suisei Armée de Terre during the §y20s§!. However, with pacifism and anti-militarism on the way out, Fabry's future in parliament is uncertain."

SUI_francois_darlan_desc:0 "§CFrançois Darlan\nMinister of the Navy§!\n§cPro-Yagoo Kleptocracy§!\nFrançois Darlon had participated in the §yAdriatic Blockade§! from §y1912§! to §y1917§! when the §mThird Republic§! surrendred. He was offered a position as Vice-Admiral under Suisei after the §yGreat War§! but played a larger role representing Suisei in the §yOMGP (Organisation for the Maintenance of the Geneva Protocols)§! where he, quite contrarily to his peers, supported the presence of a large military especially in regards to the navy. Dye to his contentious attitude, he was replaced by Maurice Bokanowski and subsequently retired from his position in the navy. Following his departure from the navy, he entered politics on behalf of the §c'Action for the People', a minor national conservative party§! that made up only a handful of seats in parliament when it merged into the §l'Front National' coalition.§! However, Darlan began to see success especially after the §yGreat Scare§! due to his campaigning for a stronger merchant marine. Despite his flamboyance and evident pro-military stance, he was elected to parliament and appointed Minister of the Navy due to his connections, experience and support for popular policies at the time."

SUI_georges_etienne_bonnet_desc:0 "§CGeorges Bonnet\nForeign Minister§!\n§lPro-Yagoo Progressive§!\nGeorges Bonnet proved to be one of the more popular ministerS during the §lpacifist wave§! of the §y1920s§!. He served in the §yGreat War§! on the side of the §dHololive Revolutionaries§! until the surrender of the §mThird Republic§! but did not support the crackdowns after the §y1919 Anti-Hololive Spring§!. Nevertheless, he was elected to parliament in §y1920§! after the first set of elections on behalf of the §lLibérals-Conservatifs§!. Bonnet was at the forefront of the §yOMGP (Organisation for the Maintenance of the Geneva Protocols)§! and was appointed Foreign Minister for the first time in §y1924§!, a post which he built the reputation of being a competant statesman and excelling at political intrigue. Despite maintaining his seat in the §y1928§! and §y1932§! elections, his position as foreign minister only returned in 1934 when the §d'Front National'§! formed a majority in parliament and reinstated him in the position. In §y1935§!, Bonnet was the leading figure of the §yRichmond Accords§!, the first major negotiations between the §dLHS§! and the §DResistance§!, and encouraged a policy of appeasement and détente with the §DResistance§!; pushing the notion that reform within the §dLHS§! will bring the discontented members back into the fold."

SUI_paul_painleve_desc:0 "§CPaul Painlevé\nArmaments Minister§!\n§lPro-Yagoo Progressive§!\nPaul Painlevé had been a minister in the government of the §mThird Republic§! prior to the war and had briefly been Prime Minister towards the end. Like many others, he stayed in the new §mFourth Republic§! temporarily; even spending some time in office. However, after politics in the North became more §Sradical§!, he left for Marseilles where he continued his political career. Painlevé saw little success due to his role in the §yGreat War§! and only won his first seat in §Y1934§! on behalf of the §lLibérals-Conservatifs§! due to the §munpopularity§! of the other candidates. Despite his shortcomings, he was well renowned in the field of aeronautics and had been at the forefront of the development of the §y'Comet'§! series of fighters."

SUI_albert_bedouce_desc:0 "§CAlbert Bedouce\nMinister of the Economy§!\n§lPro-Yagoo Progressive§!\nAlbert Debouce by the Great War was already an experienced minister and was one of the few deputies to support the §dHololive movement§! prior to the §yrevolutions of 1912§!. This support however, had led to him being politically isolated by the generally §mpro-war parties§! when the war broke out and he soon lost his seat in the parliamentary turmoil that followed France's entry into the §yGreat War§!. His support for the §dHololive movement§! became more public once Suisei had risen up in the South of France in §y1914§! but Debouce showed little interest in being a part of the provisional government. Once the war had ended, Debouce returned to politics and ran as an independent for the first constituency for Toulouse and later running as a member of the early §sCUT§!. However, as the §DCUT§! began to shift towards §sauthoritarianism-populism§! and §Nprotectionism§!, Debouce along with several other discontented ministers left and formed the §lRepublican Socialist§! party which stood for the values of the former §mFrench Republic§!. In the §y1934§! elections, Debouce had been extremely reluctant to join the §d'Front National' coalition§! and had only narrowly been convinced by Blum to join in order to limit the power of the §DCUT alliance.§!"

SUI_yvon_delbos_desc:0 "§CYvon Delbos\nMinister of [holo_parliament_lhs_resistance_affairs]§!\n§lPro-Yagoo Progressive§!\nYvon Delbos was one of the more prominent supporters of the §dHololive movement§!. Prior to the war, he was a journalist and the founder of the §y'Holo Quotidiennement'§! paper that regularly preached the §dHololive ideals of peace and multinational coorperation§!. However, this changed in §y1923§! when Delbos entered the political landscape on behalf of the §lLibérals-Conservatifs§!. Although he had not won a seat §Nnationally§! until §y1934§!, Delbos had been a part of the appointed representatives to the §dLHS§! since §y1927§! and had been campaigning for closer alignment to the organisation since its establishment. Upon his electoral success in the §y1934 snap election§!, he was appointed as Minister of LHS Affairs and was assigned to repair the damage done by the previous §DCUT§! regime."

great_depression_suisei_one_desc:0 "The Great Depression was coined to the collapse in market capital of numerous stock exchanges around Europe and North America. For Suisei, the meltdown of the tropical goods supply chain since 1931 in the Great Scare compounded on the fall of Suisei's assets in the rest of Europe and led to various financial firms and conglomerates collapsing entirely. This had subsequently caused further bankruptcies and defaultings, aggravating the unemployment situation and dampening the already catastrophic economic crisis. The level of damage the depression caused forced many to involve themselves more in politics and to embrace more radical movements if it meant they could get food on the table. Naturally, the alrady dwindling popularity of the conservative coalition has made the idea of a snap election more inticing to opposition parties and movements who wish to capitalize on their loss."

For Suisei, the meltdown of the tropical goods supply chain since 1931 in the Great Scare compounded on the fall of Suisei's assets in the rest of Europe and led to various financial firms and conglomerates collapsing entirely. This had subsequently caused further bankruptcies and defaultings, aggravating the unemployment situation and dampening the already catastrophic economic crisis. The level of damage the depression caused forced many to involve themselves more in politics and to embrace more radical movements if it meant they could get food on the table. Naturally, the alrady dwindling popularity of the conservative coalition has made the idea of a snap election more inticing to opposition parties and movements who wish to capitalize on their loss."

The LHS mandated free trade between all parties involved. This meant that the preferential treatment given to colonial goods from Gabon and the Congo prior to 1928 was no longer present and the prices reflected this. Unemployment dramatically increased as wages fell even further. Entire estates were abandoned and cargo was rotting away in warehouses as the prices were not favorable to the producers. This situation only got worse as the Great Scare and Depression bankrupted major shipping firms, which led to even less goods being sold to the metropole and further economic woes for the colonies. By this time, everyone in the colonies was malcontent with the status quo.

SUI_emergency_measures_desc:0 "It had become quite evident to the conservative coalition in power that the policy of inaction and laissez-faire capitalism had been extremely unpopular amongst the working class. Demonstrations had already broken out throughout urban centres to protest the government's lack of action in the economic crisis; despite the reassurances the coalition has given that 'all will be well'. In order to save face, many parliamentarians agreed to pass the 'Cinq Nivels' act which would allow for some government spending in order to bail out major firms and to provide some stimulous in the form of public works. This was by no means a change of policy however, and many from the Coalition Uni de Travailleurs and the Parti Nationale de Gens Communs called out the government on the bill which they said will do little to resucitate the economy. However, the bill was enough to please the Parti Libéral Démocratique who had become more keen on forming a coalition with the ruling conservatives in order to keep the more radical, populist, pro-Resistance parties out of power."
SUI_bail_out_colonies:0 "Bail Out Colonies"
SUI_bail_out_colonies_desc:0 "The colonial holdings of the Congo and Gabon had been poor shape even before the Great Scare and Depression with many colonial strikes and riots breaking out, protesting the wretched conditions in both rural and urban areas. A commission was thus formed in 1927 under order of La Reine herself, dubbed the 'Rapport des Settlements Colonials Hoshimachis', to investigate the reasons for the unrest. The investigations on the ground had finished by 1929 and the commissions findings were published a few months later. It concluded that the protests that emerged in the decade were caused by a combination of anti-colonial trade-unions gaining significant traction, depressed economic conditions that were worsened after Suisei had joined the LHS and poor government management. The at the time ruling party, CUT, had a majority in parliament and quickly publicized the findings for political gain and was a major talking point in the 1932 general elections in which the CUT had won with a coalition. However, after the Great Scare and Depression dampened the economy in the metropole, chances of a swift recovery for the colonies seemed even dimmer. The Coalition Conservatif though, realized the good press and support they would get if they supported the colonies and thus, a colonial bailout and restructuring was ordered under the general stimulous package.

The support from the progressive parties was necessary to prevent a vote of no confidence against the coalition and a subsequent snap election that would follow it. These concessions came in the form of various stimulous packages,promised work programs and future reform after the depression was dealt with."

Although the dogma of the Coalition Conservatif had always been laissez-faire in nature, the worrying rise of resistance parties around the world had pushed many to compromise and provide bailouts for businesses of all kind, with the failing investment firms being on the top of the list."

Although temporary downturns were to be expected, the coalition believed that the market will eventually bring itself back on its feet and fix itself. However, even if this was the case, the action (or lack thereof) was an extremely unpopular decision that would be able to cost the coalition its short grasp on power."
