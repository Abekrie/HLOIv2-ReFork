PAV_pavolia_reine: "Pavolia Reine"
PAV_pavolia_reine_desc: "Pavolia Reine is the sultana of Brunei and a former member of the 2nd Indonesian Republic. She maintains Brunei's independence and difference from the rest of Indonesia and strongly supports the LHS in maintaining order in Indonesia. As an British educated elite, Reine has an air of nobility and motherliness about her that entrances her subjects.\n\nReine was raised in a wealthy noble family in Brunei with strong ties to the British which allowed her to have a Western education. She brought back her skillset and economic ideas back to Brunei, and on the onset of the Hololive Revolution used her influence and wealth to buy an army of mercenaries to support her following to overthrow the ruling monarchy and installed herself as the new ruling monarch. The 1920s would bring great fortune to Reine and Brunei as the discovery of oil allowed her state to grow exponentially in wealth and power.\n\nAs the situation in Indonesia deteriorates and the LHS's grip on the world weakens, Reine maintains her stance on Brunei's independence. She is hesitant to take part in the coming civil conflict but to keep Brunei's sovereignty and uphold LHS ideals, she may need to step in to bring order to chaos."
