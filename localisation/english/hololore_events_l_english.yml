They spread out throughout the world to preach a message of peace, democracy and freedom. What started with small crowds and rallies soon evolved into major events and speeches that were even covered on radio and the press. Naturally, the old order establishment took notice of these gatherings and actively worked to supress their voices wherever possible.\n Despite their messaging of peace, many followers decided that they should overthrow the governments of the world by force and replace their government with those loyal to the Hololivers. Incident after incident lead to the Ottoman Empire staging a border attack against Serbia, blaming it on the Hololivers. This war brought in the other major european powers, Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Britain and France, all joined in the Great War to contain or support the Ottoman Empire. Hololive Oshi thought of this as an opportunity to begin their revolution. In 1913, the Athens Revolt broke out, marking the 1st Hololive rebellion. This was followed by the March coup in Abyssinia and the May Riots in Cape Town. These insurrectionists proclaimed Sora, Roboco and Mel the rightful rulers of their respective territories; these positions were reluctantly accepted but after most idols supported the rebellions, it was official that the Hololive Revolution was in full gear."

  hololore.61.d:0 "1913 - Many European colonial holdings and the Chinese Warlords quickly fell to the Hololive rebellions due to already existing instability. Attention had slowly turned from each other, to these new revolts and soon a ceasefire was announced between the Entente and the Central Powers. Sora proclaims the First Hololive Kingdom after the collapse of the Ministerial Council and in Northern Europe, a batallion known as the White Fox Army performs excellently in Scandinavia, spectacularly taking Compenhagen and Malmo. \n 1914 - After numerous blunders by Sora at Uskub and Constantinople, Yagoo decided to split from the Hololive Kingdom, convinving Hitomi Chris, Aloe and A-Chan to follow him in promise of land. In Jakarta, the regional powers of Hololive Indonesia united to form the the Indonesian Coalition and launched attacks on Indochina and Australia to assist Choco and Haato. Luna and the New Eight Banner Infantry began their invasion into Mongolia, encountering minor resistance. Meanwhile in the Iberian Theatre, an Elite Cavalry charge finally broke Spanish lines which resulted in the fall of the Spanish Monarchy. 1914 also saw the March on Rome, where Pekora and her supporters stormed the Italian Parliment and demanded the immediate transfer of power which was reluctantly accepted. \n 1915 - Although coming in late to the war, Suisei managed to sweep through Southern France and after gathering a sizeable army, began her march on Paris. After 2 years of fighting, Rushia, Fubuki, Noel, Flare and Lamy had taken all major cities in the Russian Empire west of the Urals; however the war was far from over. Nene had been repelled from the Japanese mainland and Watson was rapidly losing land in Britain. Numerous attempts to break Austria Hungary from the occupied territories in the Balkans had failed miserably but after the fall of Russia, Romania quickly fell to the Yagoo armies. \n 1916 - After the collapse of the Russian Empire, a coalition of revolutionary forces began the Russian Revolution but had mostly been put down in the west by Hololive forces. After Kanata had defeated the divided Central American and Mexican armies, attention soon turned to the United States which had struggled to hold the line against Coco and Mio. Soon, with assistance from Polka and Marine, a large assault carried out on the East coast, resulting in the frontline collapsing and Washington D.C being sieged. The South American states involved in the war had also fallen in 1916, leading to the Treaty of Rio which divided the borders between the nations involved. 1916 also brought the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after an invasion from Poland, the Balkans and the new Pekoran Italy. The Battle of Paris had also wrapped up in a Suisei victory and her attention had moved to assisting Subaru in the Benelux. The OkaKoro alliance had also facilitated dominance in the Middle East, Turkey and Persia after an overwhelming victory, however unification was only narrowly rejected in the newly established governments.\n 1917 - The major invasion of the war was about to occur, Operation KFP. Germany found itself surrounded on all sides after the fall of its neighbours and the Hololivers took quick action and stormed the Rhein, Silesia and Bavaria before proper defences could be set up, and by the end of the year, Germany had fallen after the bloodiest days of the war. Washington had yet to be taken but many other parts of the United States and Canada had fallen to the Hololivers. \n 1918- Washington D.C had finally fallen after years of being under siege and following the assault was the surrender of the U.S government which finally signaled the end of the Great War which lasted more than 5 years."

  hololore.62.d:0 "With the surrender of the major nations and fighting coming to an end in most parts of the globe, the Hololivers and representatives from around the world all gathered in Geneva to discuss the terms of peace. This council however only dealt with the non-Hololive nations, with many nations managing to scrape by with major territorial losses while some were completely annexed. Soon after this council was the Council in the town of Brugg, where the Hololivers were to discuss territorial issues amongst each other. Contrary to the united, proud front that they displayed during the Geneva Council, they quickly devolved into bickering and many nations were unsatisfied with how their disputes were settled. The major ones being the Rio Grande de Sul being ceded to Ayame rather than Aqua, the establishment of a Polish and Ukranian state whose land was expected to be split between Rushia and Noel and the most unpopular by far was the establishment of the Yagooslavia, completely disregarding any agreements made between the Yagoo army that split from Sora. Shortly after the treaty was signed, A-Chan formed the Balkan League in opposition to Yagoo and Hitomi Chris went missing, never to be seen again. Aloe was the only idol in the pact that got land; getting the former territories of Hungary and Transylvania. Meanwhile, the Russian rebels in the West had been put down by Hololive Coalition forces and many revolutionaries decided to march eastwards into the Urals and Siberia to continue to fight where the revolts had succeeded. Originally it was planned under the Geneva Council that Rushia would be rewarded lands in Siberia and Central Asia, however the Hololive coalition's forces were exhausted by the end of 1920, so Fubuki, Rushia and Lamy met with the Revolutionary representatives and drew the five dash line along the Ural Mountains and a similar agreement was met with the Kazakh Rebels. After 6 years of fighting, peace had officially come and the new world went under a period of reconstruction and economic boom."

  hololore.63.d:0 "The process of reconstruction began as soon as the war ended; businesses were restarted, factories were re-opened and rubble and damaged structures were either cleared or repaired. Recovery was generally a quick process in most territories, however that doesn't mean that the 1920s were completely peaceful and prosperous. In China, a brutal set of wars and intrigue allowed for the Guramingtang to seize power. In Indonesia and the Marine Caribbean, massive plantation revolts shocked the country and crippled their economies and in Aloe Hungary, an initial growth quickly faded as political instability and societal collapse began to set in. For many, life had not changed since the Great War and in some cases, worsened under the Hololive administration. This sentiment was held especially amongst the residents of former democratic states who saw the wave of authoritarianism that the Hololivers brought. In 1921, this led to the formation to the Boston Tea Party Society, an American organisation that resulted in the birth of the Minutemen, an American Nationalist, democratic romanticist group whose ideals quickly spread to other nations. Meanwhile, a new type of thought evolved out of the Italian socialists, New Nationalism. This was the belief that peoples oppressed by the Hololivers must rise up against them, despite any ethno-religious differences that might have existed between them. Other ideologies also began to drift towards anti-Hololive sentiments and soon, a large movement was created to stand against the new Hololive Order, a movement coined as the Antis. "

  hololore.64.d:0 "During reconstruction, the world oriented itself around the Yagooslavia dominated the world in regards to military and economic strength. These set of informal trade and economic blocs evolved into the League of Hololive States (LHS), an organisation which would dominate world affairs and attempt to find peaceful solutions in conflicts and disputes. This organisation put Yagoo on top and established a system of input nations and receiving nations where the wealthier, more prosperous nations would give money to the LHS who would then give it out to the less fortunate nations. However, this money would often be sent to the most loyal pro-Yagoo states. Despite the formation of the LHS, further conflict would eventually break out. In 1928, major riots broke out in Watson England and Mio America which brought their economies to their knees and showed the crack within the Hololivers armour. In that same year, the Indonesian Coalition fell apart after plantation walkouts and was only held together by an LHS solution that still did not fix the major issues within the Coalition. In Scandinavia, there was the military coup against the civilian government of Fubuki and the White Fox Amry became de facto rulers of Fubuki's territory. However, things were about to get much worse the LHS. "

  hololore.65.t:0 "The LHS vs the Resistance"
  hololore.65.d:0 "The birth of the Resistance goes back all the way to the moment the Treaty of Brugg was signed. The rulership of the Rio Grande being handed over to the Ayame government had left a bitter taste in the mouth of many citizens of Aqua's territory. Originally, the Aqua administration had planned to deal with the situation peacefully and opted for an LHS solution first. This solution came in the form of the 1930 Rio Grande referendum which gave the people of the region the choice between Aqua or Ayame. The result of the vote was shocking to the Aqua regime who had thought that the overwhelming majority of people in the areas supported her rule. Ayame had narrowly outperformed Aqua in the polls in the status quo remained, despite the pleas of the Aqua government for recounts and investigations into the event; all of which were ignored. Meanwhile in Dallas,the LHS vote on the issue narrowly voted towards Ayame after Yagoo had finally cast his vote in the council. Seeing no other alternative, the Aqua government approved of War Plan Verde, an invasion of Ayame Argentina. The initial assault was successful, however after international condemnation and volunteers and arms being overwhelmingly weighted against Aqua, her forces were repelled and the Treaty of Santiago resulted in Aqua losing more land. Soon after the war was finished, the Morais Commission was formed out of independent law firms in order to investigate the result of the referendum. The end of the war also saw Aqua leaving the LHS and forming a new alliance, the Resistance. The Resistance shared similar values as the LHS but opposed Yagoo's unfair priviledges in the LHS and supported equality amongst all idols. The Resistance was also strongly against ideals of inter-Hololive fighting and early on, actively opposed it in any way possible. Soon, more countries began to rebel against the LHS. Shion, Coco, Haato, Matsuri, Rushia and Kanata all defected towards the Resistance while other nations like Suisei, Pekora and Watame are heavily aligned towards their position. The split in the LHS was one of the first of many events to destablize the status quo and ended the relatively good times of the 20s."

  hololore.66.d:0 "Things will take an even turn for the worst when several Yagoo shipping businesses that specialized in Indonesia and Brazilian exports suddenly went bankrupt due to the sudden change in global events. This in turn bankrupted many investors which spiraled into an array of companies, particularly ones dealing with the shipping suddenly going bankrupt and soon, tropical exports were not being picked up at the ports but rather, sat in warehouses waiting for a ship to arrive and tropical goods manufacturing collapsed in Europe. This in turn compounded on the already worsening financial situation but LHS governments made a quick move to counter this incomming depression and bought out many businesses that were failing. However, the damage had been done and economic growth suffered in 1931 due to this incident. "

  hololore.67.d:0 "Following the period of the Great Scare, Yagoo was performing poorly in the polls and quickly losing ground to A-chan who offered the people of Yagooslavia stability, economic independence and a withdrawl from costly international endeavours. This led to Yagoo renouncing internationalism temporarily in order to win back votes that he needed in the upcoming 1932 elections. This withdrawl of Yagoo support led to many conflicts and breaches of the Treaty of Brugg and Geneva Council. Such was the case in the Rushian excursion into Ukraine and the Lamy Caucauses. Another consecuence being the start of the biggest war since the Great War, The Great Northern War. The Great Northern War had begun with Noel's swift invasion of Poland and expansion of the Novo Feudum into Polish lands; a clear violation of the Geneva Council and this led to the Fubuki Junta declaring war on Noel. Fubuki attemped to get Flare, Rushia and Czechoslovakia to intervene but all refused as there was little to no benefits of attacking. This resulted in the catastrophic defeat of Fubuki at major battles such as Danzig, Konigsberg and Elbing. Although Fubuki had gained land in the invasion, the defeat of the greatest power of the world at the hands of at most, a major regional player was a humiliation. This war caused Yagoo to rescind his policy of internalism and he returned to the status quo by the end of the year. The fallout of the Scare and Great Northern War later resulted in the Polish revolt of 1935 where Polish rebels overthrew the Flare government and invaded Noel to liberate their homeland. This rebellion failed and the status quo was soon restored at the cost of the regional economies.  "

  hololore.68.d:0 "After years of socio-economic turmoil, events finally boiled over in the Great Depression. The worsening market conditions beforehand led to the closure of many European and American banks. This collapse of the financial sector due to the inability to sort out the bad loans it had given out before had catastrophic effects on the global economy, with the worst hit ones being agricultural societies such as Noel, Flare and Rushia. Global trade stood at a halt and protests, strikes and demonstrations quickly broke out as millions of dollars became worthless overnight. Some nations however faced full on societal breakdown from the depression due to the immense pressure that was already on the system such as Aloe who had struggled economically for decades and a decent standard of living was impossible for the average Hungarian. Few countries escaped the depression, these were all nations that had limited interaction with western markets or had established strong economic nationalist policies such as Pekora and Aqua. The collapse of the global economy only fueled the already growing Asacoco problem. Whole towns and villages re-orientated the livelihoods based around the drug and was hampering recovery efforts. Each nation has to decide where to move from this point, either to rebuild whatever is left of the ashes of their former economies or to take advantage of the situation to achieve their goals. "
