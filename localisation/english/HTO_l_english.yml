HTO_akai_haato: "Akai Haato"
HTO_akai_haato_desc: "Akai Haato, or Haachama as she is now known is the iron fisted, cold hearted dictator of Greater Australasia. Her presence brings fear to all those who hear her name and the entirety of the Pacific looks with worry in anticipation of her next move, for wherever Haachama conquers there is only suffering.\n\nAkai Haato was originally a normal girl who followed Yagoo's LHS doctrine to a tee, and participated in the Hololive Revolution that took down the Australian government. One day, something snapped in Akai Haato and turned her into the personality we all know her as today; Haachama. Haachama committed numerous atrocities to cement her rule in Austalia and New Zealand, and pushed the country out of the Great Depression by keeping the country under permanent war economy through her grand militarization policy which culminated in her invasion of Papua New Guinea and the Southern Philippines, leading to her ousting from the LHS.\n\nHaachama's heart calls for more conquest and more consumption, setting her eyes on Indonesia next, while the weak Chloe seems to be another juicy target. Her ultimate goal is to bring the entirety of Asia to her heel, but Haachama can only go so far alone; she must choose between aligning with one of her Resistance friends in order to forward her goals of conquest."
