MIO_ookami_mio_desc: "	Ookami Mio is the president of the Northwestern LHS American Administrative Republic, more colloquially known as Mio's America. She is known as the “new mother of America” for both her kind and motherly personality and desire to uphold pre-war America's democratic institutions along with her strong anti-Resistance stance.\n\nMio started in America as a businesswoman in Wall Street, playing big business. She eventually got involved with politics pushing for Yagooism. Unlike how the Hololive Revolution played out in the rest of the world, Mio did not endorse violent uprisings or militia forces but rather systematic change. However as the Hololive Revolution widened in America, Mio had to take control of pro-Yagooist forces in her area, most notably in New York state. After Brugg, she restored pre-revolution American style democracy in her administrative region, complete with the 2 party system.\n\nMio currently must deal with a shaky democracy that sits on the edge between a democracy of the people and an LHS police state. She must maintain democratic American ideals while keeping the dangers of Resistance ideology away from her people, along with violent mafia and trade unionists funded by Coco. It is up to Mio to restore America to its former glory."
