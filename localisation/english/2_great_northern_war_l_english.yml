CAT_great_northern_war_desc: "The Great Northern War broke out between Noel and Fubuki in 1931 over Noel's invasion of Kronii's Poland. Although that may be the most immediate cause of the conflict, tension in the region was escalating far before the war.\n\nFubuki's Wargoals: 1) To restore Kronii's borders to their pre-1931 state. 2) To remove the Baltic State under Noel's influence. 3) To prevent the rise of antis and Resistance sympathisers in the region. 4) To limit further expansion and imperialism from Noel. 5) To preserve the balance of power in Germany.\n\nNoel's Wargoals: 1) To maintain control of Kronii's former Polish lands. 2) To retake the Baltics. 3) To ensure that the LHS' grip over Europe weakens so that the chances of an independent, united Germany will increase. 4) To maintain diplomatic independence from other regional powers."

 FBK_gnw.8.desc: "Subaru prior to the Great Northern War was always hesitant of our regime. She had distrusted us and Kronii as both of our regimes were not 'democratic' enough for her standards.\n\Subaru has indicated that if we are to obtain her support when the Great Northern War restars, we will have to have a plan to restore the former constitution and return to a free democracy."

 FBK_gnw.14.t: "Rushia's Demands for Neutrality!"
 FBK_gnw.14.desc: "Rushia has demanded much of our occupied land in Russia in 'exchange' for her neutrality in the Great Northern War. This is evidently a thinly veiled threat to extract concessions from us."

 FBK_gnw.17.b: "I guess we could offer something?"

 FBK_gnw.18.t: "Rushia Backs Down!"

 FBK_gnw.20.t: "Flare Offers to be a Mediator"
 FBK_gnw.20.desc: "After all the back and forward and sabre rattling, Flare has offered to serve as a mediator between us and Noel. It is up to us to decide the harshness of the demands."
 FBK_gnw.20.a: "Let's see what our options are..."

 FBK_gnw.21.t: "Our Demands?"
 FBK_gnw.21.desc: "Although Noel's complete capitulation would be satisfying and glorious thing to achieve, things are not so simple on the diplomatic battlefield. A more reasonable and likely successful approach would be to tone down our demands. If tension between us and Noel is not too great, we can expect Noel to at least consider our original demands of restoring Kronii."
 FBK_gnw.21.a: "No compromises."
 FBK_gnw.21.b: "We could grant the Baltic States some autonomy..."
 FBK_gnw.21.c: "We could grant the Baltic States independence"

 FBK_gnw.22.t: "Our Demands?"
 FBK_gnw.22.desc: "Although Noel's complete capitulation would be satisfying and glorious thing to achieve, things are not so simple on the diplomatic battlefield. We are already in a much stronger negotiating position than Noel so we could expect to push stricter terms. However, Noel may also choose to gamble and take her slim chance of winning rather than kneel down to us."
 FBK_gnw.22.a: "No compromises."
 FBK_gnw.22.b: "We could grant the Baltic States some autonomy..."
 FBK_gnw.22.c: "We could grant the Baltic States independence"
 FBK_gnw.22.d: "All we want is Kronii's restoration"

 FBK_gnw.23.t: "Asking Subaru for Help"
 FBK_gnw.23.desc: "Subaru is a reliable and upright LHS member. We are everything but that. That fact is not lost on Subaru who prior to the Great Northern War strongly spoke out against our regime. Nevertheless we believe that Subaru wil assist us, even if it's for purely pragmatic reasons rather than any love for our regime."
 FBK_gnw.23.a: "As a fellow LHS member of course..."

 FBK_gnw.24.t: "Asking Kiara for Help"
 FBK_gnw.24.desc: "Kiara has long been Noel's rival in Germany. Prior to the Great Northern War it was she who Noel focused much of her attention and speeches against. This rivalry could prove to be extraodinarily useful in our upcoming conflict with her. However, we must remember that although Kiara is hostile towards Noel, she is no friend of ours or the LHS. Allowing Kiara to grow too powerful could result in a second Noel situation."
 FBK_gnw.24.a: "An enemy of an enemy is a friend?"
 FBK_gnw.24.b: "Maybe everything west of the Oder will be yours?"
 FBK_gnw.24.c: "Perhaps all of Germany is in fact yours?"

 FBK_gnw.25.t: "Kiara Demands Recognition of East Germany"
 FBK_gnw.25.desc: "Kiara although receptive to the ideas of supporting us has rejected our 'lowball' offer and has demanded more concrete concessions be made. She has pointed out East Germany, currently controlled by the German Reich, as what she would ideally want in an agreement."
 FBK_gnw.25.a: "We have no love for the Reich, take it"
 FBK_gnw.25.b: "We have bigger fish to fry..."

 FBK_gnw.26.t: "Kiara Wants German Lands"
 FBK_gnw.26.desc: "Kiara although receptive to the ideas of supporting us has rejected our 'lowball' offer and has demanded more concrete concessions be made. She has pointed out much of Noel's German territories in Silesia, Pommerania and Prussia. This would greatly strengthen Kiara's regime and is a major risk to regional stability. Although not our land. this offer should be carefully analysed before we make a serious mistake!"
 FBK_gnw.26.a: "Who cares...have it"
 FBK_gnw.26.b: "We have our own plans"

 FBK_gnw.27.t: "Asking Czechoslovakia for Help"
 FBK_gnw.27.desc: "Czechoslovakia has long eyed Noel's territory of Zaolzie. It originally belonged to them after the Great War but was seized by Kronii shortly after the Treaty of Brugg. During the Great Northern War they crossed the border and reconquered the territory, only for Noel's forces to arrive and demand the territory be handed over to them. The Czechoslovak army, clearly outmatched, capitulated to this demand and returned to their original territories.\n\nPromising the return of Zaolzie could secure Czechoslovakia's support when the Great Northern War resumes."
 FBK_gnw.27.a: "Perhaps Zaolzie could be yours?"

 FBK_gnw.28.t: "Asking Flare for Help"
 FBK_gnw.28.desc: "An unconventional option since she is Noel's close friend, but Flare's military is only matched by ambitions. Flare also is technically part of the LHS which would naturally push her to our side. However, Noel is very popular at home and with Flare herself. No matter what we offer her it would be a tough option for her to consider. Thus, we must make our one shot count."
 FBK_gnw.28.a: "You know...as fellow LHS members?"
 FBK_gnw.28.b: "Noel's Ukrainian lands can be yours"
 FBK_gnw.28.c: "Perhaps...all of Ukraine can be yours?"

 FBK_gnw.29.t: "Flare Wants Ukrainian Lands"
 FBK_gnw.29.desc: "Flare has considered our offer! Although a major accomplishment by itself, she has stepped up her demands and has pushed for Noel's majority Polish and Belarussian provinces be handed over to her in exchange for her support."
 FBK_gnw.29.a: "No complaints here"
 FBK_gnw.29.b: "Well actually...we might have a problem there"

 FBK_gnw.30.t: "Flare Wants Ukrainian Lands...From Rushia Too"
 FBK_gnw.30.desc: "Flare has considered our offer! Although a major accomplishment by itself, she has stepped up her demands and has pushed for our help in her experiment of a Greater Ruthenia. This is highly problematic as that would put us in conflict with all of her neighbours; Rushia being the biggest threat. Nevertheless Flare's military support is nothing to scoff at."
 FBK_gnw.30.a: "I guess we don't have a choice?"
 FBK_gnw.30.b: "That's ridiculous"

 FBK_gnw.31.t: "Asking Germany for Help"
 FBK_gnw.31.desc: "Negotiating with Antis is never good optics but desperate times call for desperate measures. Germany as it exists currently is de facto an independent nationalist and anti republic but is on paper still an LHS occupation zone. Supporting the 'independence' of this German State could be enough for their support in our war. Alternatively, we could also exchange the states of Silesia, Pomerania and parts of Prussia. Antis are always to be distrusted and despised, but opening a second front with Noel could be exactly what we need."
 FBK_gnw.31.a: "Maybe we could support your legitimacy?"
 FBK_gnw.31.b: "Perhaps German lands can be restored?"

 FBK_gnw.32.t: "Asking Rushia for Help"
 FBK_gnw.32.desc: "Out of all of the Holo members, Rushia is arguably even more hostile to our regime than Noel. Since the Treaty of Brugg, which dictated that we were to occupy Northern Russia, Rushia has made it her aim to reunite the Russian Empire under one banner no matter the cost. Only Rushia's dismal military and political instability prevented her from invading during the Great Northern War. A lot has changed since 1932 however, and Rushia is an even greater threat than once considered. Thus, offering some concessions in exchange for her support during the Great Northern War would prove to be a valuable investment."
 FBK_gnw.32.a: "With Archangelsk, you could get access to the sea..."
 FBK_gnw.32.b: "Under a restored Russia, your claim of legitimacy would be unmatched..."
 FBK_gnw.32.c: "Perhaps, a restoration of the Russian Empire is needed..."


 FBK_gnw.33.t: "Rushia Wants Even More"
 FBK_gnw.33.desc: "Even with our generous demands, Rushia has demanded that more concessions be made to win her supportm in our upcoming conflict."
 FBK_gnw.33.a: "I suppose we don't have a choice"
 FBK_gnw.33.b: "Absolutely not"

 FBK_gnw.34.t: "Rushia Wants Even More"
 FBK_gnw.34.desc: "Even with our generous demands, Rushia has demanded that more concessions be made to win her supportm in our upcoming conflict."
 FBK_gnw.34.a: "I suppose we don't have a choice"
 FBK_gnw.34.b: "Absolutely not"

 FBK_gnw.35.t: "Asking Kronii for Help"
 FBK_gnw.35.desc: "Kronii has been in the Vologdan Oblast for almost 5 years and many wish to head home. No matter what Kronii would be a supportive ally of our cause. Our general staff and intelligence agency has come up with an even better though. Rather than supporting our army in the Baltics, Kronii and her expeditionaries will sneak into occupied Poland and encourage the population to revolt. This idea is extremely risky however, and may even cause Kronii to reconsider her options to return westward."
 FBK_gnw.35.a: "We need their support"
 FBK_gnw.35.b: "Actually...we have another idea..."

 FBK_gnw.36.t: "Noel Wants Our Complete Destruction"
 FBK_gnw.36.desc: "Noel has come to us with a proposal to end the Great Northern War without bloodshed. This does not come for free though as she has listed several demands that we must agree to. Only our complete and unconditional surrender is acceptable to Noel.\n\nThese demands are outrageous even in our disadvantaged position. Even if it's solely for the sake of honour, we must fight to the bitter end."
 FBK_gnw.36.a: "Our hands are tied..."
 FBK_gnw.36.b: "We would rather die than submit"

 FBK_gnw.37.t: "The Devolution Accords"
 FBK_gnw.37.desc: "Noel has come to us with a proposal to end the Great Northern War without bloodshed. This does not come for free though as she has listed several demands that we must agree to. Outlined is independence for Denmark, Norway and our Russian lands. In addition, Noel's Baltic lands are to be returned to her. We are also required to recognize Noel's control of Poland.\n\nThese demands are outrageous even in our disadvantaged position. Even if it's solely for the sake of honour, we must fight to the bitter end."

Outlined is independence for Norway and our Russian lands. In addition, Noel's Baltic lands are to be returned to her. We are also required to recognize Noel's control of Poland.\n\nThese demands while not completely outrageous are humiliating. Even if it's solely for the sake of honour, we must fight to the bitter end."
 FBK_gnw.38.a: "Our hands are tied..."
 FBK_gnw.38.b: "We would rather die than submit"

 FBK_gnw.39.t: "The Dresden Agreements"
 FBK_gnw.39.desc: "Noel has come to us with a proposal to end the Great Northern War without bloodshed. This does not come for free though as she has listed several demands that we must agree to. Noel's Baltic lands are to be returned to her. We are also required to recognize Noel's control of Poland.\n\nThese demands are quite light considering our circumstances. If we wish to opt out of a major war, this may be our only opportunity."

 FBK_gnw.40.t: "Our Demands?"
 FBK_gnw.40.desc: "Although Noel's complete capitulation would be satisfying and glorious thing to achieve, things are not so simple on the diplomatic battlefield. We are already in a much stronger negotiating position than Noel so we could expect to push stricter terms. However, Noel may also choose to gamble and take her slim chance of winning rather than kneel down to us."
 FBK_gnw.40.a: "Only Noel's complete destruction will suffice..."
 FBK_gnw.40.b: "...but we could agree to Baltic autonomy..."
 FBK_gnw.40.c: "...perhaps independence for the Baltics is better..."
 FBK_gnw.40.d: "...or maybe the pre-1931 status quo should be returned to?"

 FBK_gnw.41.t: "Noel Wants Our Complete Destruction"
 FBK_gnw.41.desc: "Noel has come to us with a proposal to end the Great Northern War without bloodshed. This does not come for free though as she has listed several demands that we must agree to. Only our complete and unconditional surrender is acceptable to Noel.\n\nThese demands are outrageous even in our disadvantaged position. Even if it's solely for the sake of honour, we must fight to the bitter end."
 FBK_gnw.41.a: "Our hands are tied..."
 FBK_gnw.41.b: "We would rather die than submit"

 FBK_gnw.42.t: "The Devolution Accords"
 FBK_gnw.42.desc: "Noel has come to us with a proposal to end the Great Northern War without bloodshed. This does not come for free though as she has listed several demands that we must agree to. Outlined is independence for Denmark, Norway and our Russian lands. In addition, Noel's Baltic lands are to be returned to her. We are also required to recognize Noel's control of Poland.\n\nThese demands are outrageous even in our disadvantaged position. Even if it's solely for the sake of honour, we must fight to the bitter end."
 FBK_gnw.42.a: "Our hands are tied..."
 FBK_gnw.42.b: "We would rather die than submit"

 FBK_gnw.43.desc: "Noel has come to us with a proposal to end the Great Northern War without bloodshed. This does not come for free though as she has listed several demands that we must agree to. Outlined is independence for Norway and our Russian lands. In addition, Noel's Baltic lands are to be returned to her. We are also required to recognize Noel's control of Poland.\n\nThese demands while not completely outrageous are humiliating. Even if it's solely for the sake of honour, we must fight to the bitter end."

 FBK_gnw.44.desc: "Noel has come to us with a proposal to end the Great Northern War without bloodshed. This does not come for free though as she has listed several demands that we must agree to. Noel's Baltic lands are to be returned to her. We are also required to recognize Noel's control of Poland.\n\nThese demands are quite light considering our circumstances. If we wish to end the war, this may be our best bet."

 FBK_gnw.47.t: "Flare Offers Mediation"
 FBK_gnw.47.desc: "After all the back and forward and sabre rattling, Flare has offered to serve as a mediator between us and Noel. It is up to us to decide the harshness of the demands."
 FBK_gnw.47.a: "We are open to discussions"
 FBK_gnw.47.b: "No negotiating with butchers"

 FBK_gnw.48.t: "The Poland Issue?"
 FBK_gnw.48.desc: "The elephant in the room is the issue surrounding Poland. Noel has made it abundantly clear in the past that nothing but complete annexation is what she wants. Due to the negotiations however, she may budge depending on what we offer."
 FBK_gnw.48.a: "Kronii will regain her pre-1931 borders"
 FBK_gnw.48.b: "The Russo-German border in 1912 will be restored"
 FBK_gnw.48.c: "The Polish people will remain subjects of Noel"

 FBK_gnw.49.t: "The Baltic Issue?"
 FBK_gnw.49.desc: "The second major issue is that surrounding the occupied Baltic States. This land is strategically important to us and solidifies our dominance over the Baltic Sea. However, the Baltics are strongly pro-Noel and have consistently resisted our occupation efforts. This has not been helped by Noel's insistence that their occupation will soon be over.\n\nThere is an alternative though. Despite the Baltic's support for Noel, there are a sizeable minority who wish for independence. Due to Noel's track record of dealing with the Baltics involving numerous 'incidents' and 'misunderstandings', she may be open to this offer as long as German nationals can return to Noel's lands proper."
 FBK_gnw.49.a: "Finders keepers!"
 FBK_gnw.49.b: "The Baltics will become independent"
 FBK_gnw.49.c: "The Baltics will be returned to Noel"

 FBK_gnw.50.t: "The Germany Issue?"
 FBK_gnw.50.desc: "The final issue is that surrounding the title of German Emperor, or Kaiser. Originally, Kiara and Noel were simply Queens of their respective territories but since the Great Northern War both as contested this title of Kaiserin. Although a title is just a title, our silence on the matter would ensure that Noel would continue her aggressive expansion to reclaim said title. The most pragmatic solution would be to at the very least secure a promise of peace from Noel."
 FBK_gnw.50.a: "There will be no German Emperors"
 FBK_gnw.50.b: "Her title stays, but she must promise peace"
 FBK_gnw.50.c: "Continental squabbles are none of our business"

 FBK_gnw.51.t: "Kronii Begs for Weapons"
 FBK_gnw.51.desc: "Kronii has come to us to request vital military equipment to ensure that her revolt goes well. Although this is no small amount, it is undeniable that a strong Polish revolt could turn the tide of the war."
 FBK_gnw.51.a: "Here you go"
 FBK_gnw.51.b: "We have nothing to spare"
 FBK_gnw.51.c: "You're on your own"

 FBK_gnw.52.t: "Re-Examine Our Tank Strategy"
 FBK_gnw.52.desc: "In the Great Northern War, the majority of our tanks were the light model Stridsvagn m/35 with some Stridsvagn m/31s and heavier tanks. Although competent vehicles and significantly more capable than Noel's PzKpfw models, they still struggled to make breakthroughs when faced with stiff resistance such as in the Suvalkijan Campaign. Due to this, many have insisted that we double down on our tank research and look for ways to make our armour heavier.\n\nOn the flip side many have pushed the idea that tanks are to be used in unison with other weaponry such as anti-tank guns and anti-air guns to counter any combination of units that Noel could muster. Focusing on this however would take away from vital resources that we could potentially invest in armour. Considering the circumstances either option can be the key we need to overcoming our enemies."
 FBK_gnw.52.a: "We clearly didn't invest enough in them"
 FBK_gnw.52.b: "We should focus on countering Noel's tanks instead"

 FBK_gnw.53.t: "Latgalian Autonomy?"
 FBK_gnw.53.desc: "The Latgalians are a people generally located in the Eastern section of Latvia. Although never having a strong independence movement, they generally see themselves as a separate ethnicity to Latvians and wish to retain their culture. Thus it could be wise to use this to our advantageous and grant the Latgalians autonomy in their homeland. This would make the local people more willing to cooperate with us and we could muster a division from the Latgalians. However this could run this risk of more Baltic peoples wishing to achieve a level of autonomy."
 FBK_gnw.53.a: "What's the worst that could happen?"
 FBK_gnw.53.b: "No"

 FBK_gnw.54.t: "Russian Territorial Brigades?"
 FBK_gnw.54.desc: "Currently, ethnic Russians are prohibited in serving in our armed forces. This is due to previous incidents of mutinies and misconduct. Due to our circumstances though we should consider at least allowing them to serve in our Territorial Brigades which act as the garrisons in the area. This would take tremendous stress off of our limited population in Scandinavia and Finland. However, this move would not be popular amongst Russians who generally are not willing to see their fellow countrymen die on the side of an occupying country."
 FBK_gnw.54.a: "What's the worst that could happen?"
 FBK_gnw.54.b: "No"

 FBK_gnw.55.t: "Autonomy for Schleswig Holstein"
 FBK_gnw.55.desc: "In the Treaty of Brugg, Germany was divided up between us, Subaru, Noel, Kronii, Kiara and an LHS Occupation Zone. We were granted the smallest portion, Schleswig-Holstein. Although much of the population considers themselves Danish, the absolute majority is German. This has caused problems for us as the Danish population wants to be integrated as a proper administrative region while the German population resists any notion of integration, oftentimes using violence. A solution to this could be to grant the entire region of Schleswig-Holstein self-rule. This state would of course be under our supervision and the resident Scandinavian population would receive greater representation than the German population. The only downside may potentially be the region breaking off against our will and joining another German state."
 FBK_gnw.55.a: "What's the worst that could happen?"
 FBK_gnw.55.b: "No"

 FBK_gnw.56.t: "Subaru Agrees to Help Us"

 FBK_post_gnw.4.t: "Rumours of a Baltic Rebellion"
 FBK_post_gnw.4.desc: "Word has come to us that groups of armed ex-German soldiers and partisans have allied under a united front calling themselves the Forest Brothers. Reports say that this united front is more than any old rebellion but instead a well organized group with the aim of liberating the Baltics under one German banner."
 FBK_post_gnw.4.a: "Sounds dangerous"

 FBK_post_gnw.5.t: "Speech Sabotaged!"
 FBK_post_gnw.5.desc: "During Fubuki's speech in Tallinn today, an explosion was heard in a nearby bar. Due to national security concerns Fubuki was escorted out and the speech had to be cancelled. The Forest Brothers were quick to take responsability for this action. This act will only motivated further moves by the insurgents."
 FBK_post_gnw.5.a: "Damn!"

 FBK_post_gnw.6.t: "Speech Applauded!"
 FBK_post_gnw.6.desc: "Fubuki's speech in Tallinn occured without any problems. After the event was over, she was treated to a rousing round of applause from her audience. This is a clear indication that the process of integration is so far, successful."
 FBK_post_gnw.6.a: "Of course it would be!"

 FBK_post_gnw.7.t: "Noel's Smuggling Campaign"
 FBK_post_gnw.7.desc: "Our intelligence agency has indicated to us that Noel has permitted and allegedly even supported the Forest Brothers' smuggling campaign. Weapons, amunition and other essential supplies for a guerrilla campaign has been crossing the border from East Prussia. Noel has neither denounced nor put any effort to putting an stop to this operation."
 FBK_post_gnw.7.a: "We must put an end to this"

 FBK_post_gnw.10.t: "Dealing with Noel"
 FBK_post_gnw.10.desc: "In order to put a stop to the smuggling campaign, we could take the following actions. The first option would be to show Noel that we mean business, and force her to take action to secure her borders by displaying our military might. The second option would be to issue a diplomatic protest to her. The third and final option would be to up our border patrols to ensure that no one crosses the border through non-permitted routes."

 FBK_post_gnw.19.t: "Revolt Prevented!"
 FBK_post_gnw.19.desc: "Shots have been heard across the occupied Baltic territories. When investigated, it turned it to simply be a group of Forest Brothers fighting another rival group for supplies. Recent reports have shown that the dwindling support and resources of the Forest Brothers has caused the group to splinter. More and more groups have fled the country across the border or been handing themselves in. This is a victory for our regime."
