CAT_great_northern_war_desc: "The Great Northern War broke out between Noel and Fubuki in 1931 over Noel's invasion of Kronii's Poland. Although that may be the most immediate cause of the conflict, tension in the region was escalating far before the war.\n\nFubuki's Wargoals: 1) To restore Kronii's borders to their pre-1931 state. 2) To remove the Baltic State under Noel's influence. 3) To prevent the rise of antis and Resistance sympathisers in the region. 4) To limit further expansion and imperialism from Noel. 5) To preserve the balance of power in Germany.\n\nNoel's Wargoals: 1) To maintain control of Kronii's former Polish lands. 2) To retake the Baltics. 3) To ensure that the LHS' grip over Europe weakens so that the chances of an independent, united Germany will increase. 4) To maintain diplomatic independence from other regional powers."
