CAT_great_northern_war_desc: "The Great Northern War broke out between Noel and Fubuki in 1931 over Noel's invasion of Kronii's Poland. Although that may be the most immediate cause of the conflict, tension in the region was escalating far before the war.\n\nFubuki's Wargoals: 1) To restore Kronii's borders to their pre-1931 state. 2) To remove the Baltic State under Noel's influence. 3) To prevent the rise of antis and Resistance sympathisers in the region. 4) To limit further expansion and imperialism from Noel. 5) To preserve the balance of power in Germany.\n\nNoel's Wargoals: 1) To maintain control of Kronii's former Polish lands. 2) To retake the Baltics. 3) To ensure that the LHS' grip over Europe weakens so that the chances of an independent, united Germany will increase. 4) To maintain diplomatic independence from other regional powers."

gnw_info.1.t: "Preparing for Another War"
gnw_info.1.desc: "Fubuki was never able to truly accept our victory in the Great Northern War. The peace treaty overseen by Yagoo was merely a lull to allow Fubuki time to rebuild her army and devise new plans for invasion. Our proud army must be ready to defend our fatherland and our queen from Fubuki's aggression once more."
gnw_info.1.a: "The bigger they are the harder they fall"

gnw_info.2.t: "Examine Our Equipment"
gnw_info.2.desc: "The Heer, much like the famous Prussian army, was an elite force of professional soldiers and officers, supplemented by conscripted serfs from our Polish lands. However while its soldiers were well trained and led by competent officers, its weaponry was less than adequate. The army was still heavily reliant on bolt action rifles and heavy machine guns, including weapons captured from the Poles. This was in stark contrast to the rest of Europe which had begun to standardize sub-machine guns, light machine guns and semi-automatic rifles."
gnw_info.2.a: "Good...good..."

gnw_info.3.t: "Examine Our Airforce"
gnw_info.3.desc: "Our air force, the Luftstreitkräfte had proven itself as a valuable branch of our military during The Great War and Great Northern War, showing that air power is key to victory on the battlefield. While the Luftstreitkräfte had capable pilots, it was still reliant on pre-Great Northern War bi-plane designs. With other air forces adopting monoplanes, it was vital that the Luftstreitkräfte use the latest plane designs to keep up with the rest of Europe."
gnw_info.3.a: "A marvel of German engineering"

gnw_info.4.t: "Examine Our Navy"
gnw_info.4.desc: "During the Great Northern War, control over the Baltic Sea had become a top priority. To do this, the Kaiserliche Marine had changed its tactics. Rather than engage Fubuki's fleet using surface ships, the Kaiserliche Marine almost entirely depended on U-boats to harass Fubuki's supply lines. Years later, the Kaiserliche Marine's U-Boat fleet remained as the most elite fighting force to defend the high seas. However the surface fleet did not fare better. Due to its inaction during the war and the greater emphasis placed on the U-boats, the surface fleet was given less priority. With only two capital ships, a few cruisers and destroyers, the Kaiserliche Marine's surface fleet was in need of a serious overhaul in order to guard the Baltic Sea."
gnw_info.4.a: "Well...it could be worse"

gnw_info.5.t: "Through the Fire and the Flames"
gnw_info.5.desc: "In 1932, our empire under Fubuki faced its greatest challenge at the time. Noel's sudden invasion of Poland under Kronii was a severe violation of the Treaty of Brugg. In an attempt to stop her Fubuki launched a preemptive strike against Noel, sending her forces across the sea onto Baltic shores to aid Kronii. For several long and agonizing months, our sons bled, fighting Noel's armies, disease and attrition. Unfortunately their sacrifices would do nothing as Noel and Fubuki signed an armistice, which allowed for Kronii's territory to be completely annexed by Noel. Several years after the first war, Noel was once again on the path to subjugate the free people of Northern Europe. And once more Fubuki had called her men to defend the empire, and end Noel's expansionism once and for all."
gnw_info.5.a: "We are in it to win it"

gnw_info.6.t: "Fixing Our Military"
gnw_info.6.desc: "One of the major issues we faced early on was the state of our military. Although the First Great Northern War was a few years ago, our army was slow to learn the mistakes made during the conflict, with officers giving their men outdated weaponry and using old tactics. With Noel having militarized at a faster pace, it is vital that our army becomes just as capable as the Prussians"
gnw_info.6.a: "We are in it to win it"

gnw_info.7.t: "Why We Fight"
gnw_info.7.desc: "As the war dragged on and casualties on the frontlines increased, we faced another threat to our fight against Noel's Germany. In the streets of Stockholm, Helsinki, Copenhagen and other large cities, anti-war protests, riots and graffiti increased exponentially. People began to question why we were fighting Noel in the first place and whether the deaths of their sons and fathers on the frontlines was worth it. To remedy this, we had 2 choices. Either we tell the people this war is to liberate the German people from a war hungry tyrant, or we say that we are fighting to avenge our national honor and those who died in the first Great Northern War."
gnw_info.7.a: "We must remind people why we fight"

gnw_news_events.1.t: "Germany and Noel Unite"
gnw_news_events.1.desc: "For the first time since the end of the Great War, Berlin has come under the control of Prussia. The German Reich has been annexed by Noel's Kingdom of Germany, greatly expanding her territory. Not only did this give her an advantage in manpower and industry, but has also given her access to attack Schleswing-Holstein and Denmark, expanding the war to one of Fubuki's core territories."
gnw_news_events.1.a: "The Prussians march once more."

gnw_news_events.2.t: "Kronii Supports Fubuki"
gnw_news_events.2.desc: "With most of her demands met and realizing she will need protection against the ever-expanding Rushian Empire, Kronii has pledged her support for Fubuki in her fight against Noel, to better secure relations with the Scandinavian Empire"
gnw_news_events.2.a: "Fubuki's alliance grows."

gnw_news_events.3.t: "Flare and Germany Unite!"
gnw_news_events.3.desc: "News has emerged from the former Germany, as the nationalistic German Reich has been absorbed by the Federal German Kingdom under Kiara. With the annexation of Berlin, Kiara is one step closer to the full unification of all German lands. Her rivalry with the other self proclaimed German Queen, Noel, could prove to be vital for Fubuki's war against Noel."
gnw_news_events.3.a: "The Phoenix of Germany has risen"

gnw_news_events.4.t: "The Great Northern War Resumes"
gnw_news_events.4.desc: "Since 1932, after the bloody but short first Great Northern War, Fubuki and Noel had been steadily healing their wounds and preparing for the second round. Soon the conflict years in the making would explode, as Fubuki would once again go to war to halt Noel's growing influence in the Baltics. Having learned their lessons from the first conflict, the Second Great Northern War is set to become bloodier than the last."
gnw_news_events.4.a: "The Baltic Sea will run red with blood."

gnw_news_events.5.t: "Noel's Victory in the Great Northern War"
gnw_news_events.5.desc: "After years of brutal fighting and nearing economic collapse, The Kingdom of Germany under Noel has successfully repelled Fubuki's attempts to subjugate the rising nation. Much like Prussia more than 70 years ago, the ever-growing kingdom has secured itself on the European stage and is set to expand its influence into the former German lands."
gnw_news_events.5.a: "Prussia has risen once again"

gnw_news_events.6.t: "Fubuki's Victory in the Great Northern War"
gnw_news_events.6.desc: "Thanks to a swift victory due in large part to her allies and vassals, Fubuki has succeeded where she had failed years ago and has finally halted Noel's expansion. Though The Scandinavian Empire is racked with anti-war protests and predatory empires neighboring her are preparing to take advantage of the empire's weakened state, Fubuki has shown she and her allies are capable of defending her empire from any threat."
gnw_news_events.6.a: "The Baltics have been secured."

gnw_news_events.7.t: "Rushia Makes Her Move"
gnw_news_events.7.desc: "With Fubuki's empire in turmoil after the Second Great Northern War, Rushia has seen it as her chance to seize Fubuki's and Kronii's holdings in Northern Russia. As reports of fighting along the Russian frontier and Urals filtered into Stockholm, Fubuki once again called upon her soldiers and her various allies to defend the Scandinavian Empire."
gnw_news_events.7.a: "Russia once more has become a battleground."

 FBK_gnw.21.t: "Our Demands?"
 FBK_gnw.21.desc: "Although Noel's complete capitulation would be satisfying and glorious thing to achieve, things are not so simple on the diplomatic battlefield.

 FBK_gnw.22.t: "Our Demands?"

 FBK_gnw.23.t: "Asking Subaru for Help"
 FBK_gnw.23.desc: "Subaru is a reliable and upright LHS member. We are everything but that. That fact is not lost on Subaru who prior to the Great Northern War strongly spoke out against our regime. Nevertheless we believe that Subaru wil assist us, even if it's for purely pragmatic reasons rather than any love for our regime."
 FBK_gnw.23.a: "As a fellow LHS member of course..."

 FBK_gnw.24.t: "Asking Kiara for Help"
 FBK_gnw.24.desc: "Kiara has long been Noel's rival in Germany. Prior to the Great Northern War it was she who Noel focused much of her attention and speeches against. This rivalry could prove to be extraodinarily useful in our upcoming conflict with her. However, we must remember that although Kiara is hostile towards Noel, she is no friend of ours or the LHS. Allowing Kiara to grow too powerful could result in a second Noel situation."
 FBK_gnw.24.a: "An enemy of an enemy is a friend?"
 FBK_gnw.24.b: "Maybe everything west of the Oder will be yours?"
 FBK_gnw.24.c: "Perhaps all of Germany is in fact yours?"

 FBK_gnw.25.t: "Kiara Demands Recognition of East Germany"
 FBK_gnw.25.desc: "Kiara although receptive to the ideas of supporting us has rejected our 'lowball' offer and has demanded more concrete concessions be made. She has pointed out East Germany, currently controlled by the German Reich, as what she would ideally want in an agreement."
 FBK_gnw.25.a: "We have no love for the Reich, take it"
 FBK_gnw.25.b: "We have bigger fish to fry..."

 FBK_gnw.26.t: "Kiara Wants German Lands"
 FBK_gnw.26.desc: "Kiara although receptive to the ideas of supporting us has rejected our 'lowball' offer and has demanded more concrete concessions be made. She has pointed out much of Noel's German territories in Silesia, Pommerania and Prussia. This would greatly strengthen Kiara's regime and is a major risk to regional stability. Although not our land. this offer should be carefully analysed before we make a serious mistake!"
 FBK_gnw.26.a: "Who cares...have it"
 FBK_gnw.26.b: "We have our own plans"

 FBK_gnw.27.t: "Asking Czechoslovakia for Help"
 FBK_gnw.27.desc: "Czechoslovakia has long eyed Noel's territory of Zaolzie. It originally belonged to them after the Great War but was seized by Kronii shortly after the Treaty of Brugg. During the Great Northern War they crossed the border and reconquered the territory, only for Noel's forces to arrive and demand the territory be handed over to them. The Czechoslovak army, clearly outmatched, capitulated to this demand and returned to their original territories.\n\nPromising the return of Zaolzie could secure Czechoslovakia's support when the Great Northern War resumes."
 FBK_gnw.27.a: "Perhaps Zaolzie could be yours?"

 FBK_gnw.28.t: "Asking Flare for Help"
 FBK_gnw.28.desc: "An unconventional option since she is Noel's close friend, but Flare's military is only matched by ambitions. Flare also is technically part of the LHS which would naturally push her to our side. However, Noel is very popular at home and with Flare herself. No matter what we offer her it would be a tough option for her to consider. Thus, we must make our one shot count."
 FBK_gnw.28.a: "You know...as fellow LHS members?"
 FBK_gnw.28.b: "Noel's Ukrainian lands can be yours"
 FBK_gnw.28.c: "Perhaps...all of Ukraine can be yours?"

 FBK_gnw.29.t: "Flare Wants Ukrainian Lands"
 FBK_gnw.29.desc: "Flare has considered our offer! Although a major accomplishment by itself, she has stepped up her demands and has pushed for Noel's majority Polish and Belarussian provinces be handed over to her in exchange for her support."
 FBK_gnw.29.a: "No complaints here"
 FBK_gnw.29.b: "Well actually...we might have a problem there"

 FBK_gnw.30.t: "Flare Wants Ukrainian Lands...From Rushia Too"
 FBK_gnw.30.desc: "Flare has considered our offer! Although a major accomplishment by itself, she has stepped up her demands and has pushed for our help in her experiment of a Greater Ruthenia. This is highly problematic as that would put us in conflict with all of her neighbours; Rushia being the biggest threat. Nevertheless Flare's military support is nothing to scoff at."
 FBK_gnw.30.a: "I guess we don't have a choice?"
 FBK_gnw.30.b: "That's ridiculous"

 FBK_gnw.31.t: "Asking Germany for Help"
 FBK_gnw.31.desc: "Negotiating with Antis is never good optics but desperate times call for desperate measures. Germany as it exists currently is de facto an independent nationalist and anti republic but is on paper still an LHS occupation zone. Supporting the 'independence' of this German State could be enough for their support in our war. Alternatively, we could also exchange the states of Silesia, Pomerania and parts of Prussia. Antis are always to be distrusted and despised, but opening a second front with Noel could be exactly what we need."
 FBK_gnw.31.a: "Maybe we could support your legitimacy?"
 FBK_gnw.31.b: "Perhaps German lands can be restored?"

 FBK_gnw.32.t: "Asking Rushia for Help"
 FBK_gnw.32.desc: "Out of all of the Holo members, Rushia is arguably even more hostile to our regime than Noel. Since the Treaty of Brugg, which dictated that we were to occupy Northern Russia, Rushia has made it her aim to reunite the Russian Empire under one banner no matter the cost. Only Rushia's dismal military and political instability prevented her from invading during the Great Northern War. A lot has changed since 1932 however, and Rushia is an even greater threat than once considered. Thus, offering some concessions in exchange for her support during the Great Northern War would prove to be a valuable investment."
 FBK_gnw.32.a: "With Archangelsk, you could get access to the sea..."
 FBK_gnw.32.b: "Under a restored Russia, your claim of legitimacy would be unmatched..."
 FBK_gnw.32.c: "Perhaps, a restoration of the Russian Empire is needed..."

 FBK_gnw.35.t: "Asking Kronii for Help"
 FBK_gnw.35.desc: "Kronii has been in the Komi Oblast for almost 5 years and many wish to head home. No matter what Kronii would be a supportive ally of our cause. Our general staff and intelligence agency has come up with an even better though. Rather than supporting our army in the Baltics, Kronii and her expeditionaries will sneak into occupied Poland and encourage the population to revolt. This idea is extremely risky however, and may even cause Kronii to reconsider her options to return westward."
 FBK_gnw.35.a: "We need their support"
 FBK_gnw.35.b: "Actually...we have another idea..."

 FBK_gnw.36.t: "Noel Wants Our Complete Destruction"
 FBK_gnw.36.desc: "Noel has come to us with a proposal to end the Great Northern War without bloodshed. This does not come for free though as she has listed several demands that we must agree to. Only our complete and unconditional surrender is acceptable to Noel.\n\nThese demands are outrageous even in our disadvantaged position.

 FBK_gnw.40.t: "Our Demands?"
 FBK_gnw.40.desc: "Although Noel's complete capitulation would be satisfying and glorious thing to achieve, things are not so simple on the diplomatic battlefield. We are already in a much stronger negotiating position than Noel so we could expect to push stricter terms. However, Noel may also choose to gamble and take her slim chance of winning rather than kneel down to us."
 FBK_gnw.40.a: "Only Noel's complete destruction will suffice..."
 FBK_gnw.40.b: "...but we could agree to Baltic autonomy..."

 FBK_gnw.48.t: "The Poland Issue?"

 FBK_gnw.48.b: "The Russo-German border in 1912 will be restored"

 FBK_gnw.49.t: "The Baltic Issue?"
 FBK_gnw.49.desc: "The second major issue is that surrounding the occupied Baltic States. This land is strategically important to us and solidifies our dominance over the Baltic Sea. However, the Baltics are strongly pro-Noel and have consistently resisted our occupation efforts. This has not been helped by Noel's insistence that their occupation will soon be over.\n\nThere is an alternative though. Despite the Baltic's support for Noel, there are a sizeable minority who wish for independence. Due to Noel's track record of dealing with the Baltics involving numerous 'incidents' and 'misunderstandings', she may be open to this offer as long as German nationals can return to Noel's lands proper."
 FBK_gnw.49.a: "Finders keepers!"
 FBK_gnw.49.b: "The Baltics will become independent"
 FBK_gnw.49.c: "The Baltics will be returned to Noel"

 FBK_gnw.50.t: "The Germany Issue?"
 FBK_gnw.50.desc: "The final issue is that surrounding the title of German Emperor, or Kaiser. Originally, Kiara and Noel were simply Queens of their respective territories but since the Great Northern War both as contested this title of Kaiserin. Although a title is just a title, our silence on the matter would ensure that Noel would continue her aggressive expansion to reclaim said title. The most pragmatic solution would be to at the very least secure a promise of peace from Noel."
 FBK_gnw.50.a: "There will be no German Emperors"
 FBK_gnw.50.b: "Her title stays, but she must promise peace"
 FBK_gnw.50.c: "Continental squabbles are none of our business"

 FBK_gnw.51.c: "You're on your own"

 FBK_gnw.52.t: "Re-Examine Our Tank Strategy"
 FBK_gnw.52.desc: "In the Great Northern War, the majority of our tanks were the light model Stridsvagn m/35 with some Stridsvagn m/31s and heavier tanks. Although competent vehicles and significantly more capable than Noel's PzKpfw models, they still struggled to make breakthroughs when faced with stiff resistance such as in the Suvalkijan Campaign. Due to this, many have insisted that we double down on our tank research and look for ways to make our armour heavier.\n\nOn the flip side many have pushed the idea that tanks are to be used in unison with other weaponry such as anti-tank guns and anti-air guns to counter any combination of units that Noel could muster. Focusing on this however would take away from vital resources that we could potentially invest in armour. Considering the circumstances either option can be the key we need to overcoming our enemies."
 FBK_gnw.52.a: "We clearly didn't invest enough in them"
 FBK_gnw.52.b: "We should focus on countering Noel's tanks instead"

 FBK_gnw.53.t: "Latgalian Autonomy?"
 FBK_gnw.53.desc: "The Latgalians are a people generally located in the Eastern section of Latvia. Although never having a strong independence movement, they generally see themselves as a separate ethnicity to Latvians and wish to retain their culture. Thus it could be wise to use this to our advantageous and grant the Latgalians autonomy in their homeland. This would make the local people more willing to cooperate with us and we could muster a division from the Latgalians. However this could run this risk of more Baltic peoples wishing to achieve a level of autonomy."
 FBK_gnw.53.a: "What's the worst that could happen?"
 FBK_gnw.53.b: "No"

 FBK_gnw.54.t: "Russian Territorial Brigades?"
 FBK_gnw.54.desc: "Currently, ethnic Russians are prohibited in serving in our armed forces. This is due to previous incidents of mutinies and misconduct. Due to our circumstances though we should consider at least allowing them to serve in our Territorial Brigades which act as the garrisons in the area. This would take tremendous stress off of our limited population in Scandinavia and Finland. However, this move would not be popular amongst Russians who generally are not willing to see their fellow countrymen die on the side of an occupying country."

 FBK_gnw.54.b: "No"

 FBK_gnw.55.t: "Autonomy for Schleswig Holstein"
 FBK_gnw.55.desc: "In the Treaty of Brugg, Germany was divided up between us, Subaru, Noel, Kronii, Kiara and an LHS Occupation Zone. We were granted the smallest portion, Schleswig-Holstein. Although much of the population considers themselves Danish, the absolute majority is German. This has caused problems for us as the Danish population wants to be integrated as a proper administrative region while the German population resists any notion of integration, oftentimes using violence. A solution to this could be to grant the entire region of Schleswig-Holstein self-rule. This state would of course be under our supervision and the resident Scandinavian population would receive greater representation than the German population. The only downside may potentially be the region breaking off against our will and joining another German state."

The first option would be to show Noel that we mean business, and force her to take action to secure her borders by displaying our military might. The second option would be to issue a diplomatic protest to her. The third and final option would be to up our border patrols to ensure that no one crosses the border through non-permitted routes."
