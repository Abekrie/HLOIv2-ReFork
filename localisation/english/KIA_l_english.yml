KIA_takanashi_kiara: "Takanashi Kiara"
KIA_takanashi_kiara_desc: "KIara Takanashi has had a long storied career leading up to her present position as the President of South Germany. Known for her gentle ruling style while promoting many profitable enterprises, she has won the hearts and minds of many living in these territories, as she seeks to continue the reconstruction of Germany from the chaos of the Great War.\n\nThese efforts have not been without stumbling blocks, however. The wave of anti revolutions in 1920, back when she was still overseer of the German Occupation Zone, still scars the land now. To combat this weariness, Kiara launched an economic program to kickstart German growth and development. Her efforts paid off, with many seeing the success of the Occupation Zone as a renaissance of German culture.\n\nAll good things must come to an end, however. The renaissance ended abruptly with the outbreak of the Great Depression, and despite the best efforts of Kiara and her supporters, the economic downturn has replaced the prosperity of before. The anti parties, driven into exile after the 1920 coup, are festering once more. The failure of the LHS to assist in recovery too has shaken Kiara's faith in Yagooism as a new nationalist movement seeks to include Kiara at its center rather than on the sidelines. By 1936, Kiara must tread all these variable forces as she tries to navigate out of the oncoming firestorm."

KIA_takanashi_kiara_trait: "Kaisarin?"

 kiara.1.t: "Noel Demands Our Annexation"
 kiara.1.d: "Kaiserin, we have a problem! Noel has formally declared her intent of German Reunification. The demands are simple, incorporation into the new German state she leads. We must carefully consider our next step, we may play a key role in a truly remarkable achievement but we must consider that history will not recognise our part in it. Whether we can truly work with Noel is another problem in itself, her ideas are overly… traditional. With our strong industrial backbone and her… feudalistic ideas, Europe may see a threat not seen in decades on its hands. Ours."
 kiara.1.a: "We shall place our trust in Noel that we may still prosper from this in time."
 kiara.1.b: "Nur über meine Leiche! Germany may yet be unified but I refuse to hand over the keys to a pretender such as her!"

 kiara.2.t: "Noel Demands A Confederation"
 kiara.2.d: "Kaiserin, a formal invitation has arrived to join Noel’s German confederacy. With the transition to formal democracy, each state has a much greater say in the future of the nation and we are formally invited to join this new confederation. It might be very prudent of us to consider this if democracy is truly the future then there may not be a better time than the present for Germany to re-emerge as a major player in Europe. This will however mean our independence and our own ideas will come to an end."
 kiara.2.a: "A new, democratic future for Germany lies ahead!"
 kiara.2.b: "Germany never has, and if I have any say in the matter, never will be subsumed by these inefficient ideas of democracy. Schändlich!"

 kiara.3.t: "Fubuki cedes Schleswig-Holstein"
 kiara.3.d: "Our petition for the return of Schleswig-Holstein to true German control has been received. Fubuki has acquiesced to the demands and the people of Germany welcome their family back to the fold!"
 kiara.3.a: "Unglaublich! Today is a truly wonderful day!"

 kiara.4.t: "Fubuki Denies us schleswig-Holstein"
 kiara.4.d: "Kaiserin, a word from Fubuki. She seems to think that the people of Schleswig-Holstein should remain under her control despite our clear and justified petitions to the contrary. It would seem our people will have to wait for the day they may return home once again."
 kiara.4.a: "Schiesse! Was für ein beschissener Tag!"
