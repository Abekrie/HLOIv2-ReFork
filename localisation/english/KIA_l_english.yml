KIA_takanashi_kiara: "Takanashi Kiara"
KIA_takanashi_kiara_desc: "KIara Takanashi has had a long storied career leading up to her present position as the President of South Germany. Known for her gentle ruling style while promoting many profitable enterprises, she has won the hearts and minds of many living in these territories, as she seeks to continue the reconstruction of Germany from the chaos of the Great War.\n\nThese efforts have not been without stumbling blocks, however. The wave of anti revolutions in 1920, back when she was still overseer of the German Occupation Zone, still scars the land now. To combat this weariness, Kiara launched an economic program to kickstart German growth and development. Her efforts paid off, with many seeing the success of the Occupation Zone as a renaissance of German culture.\n\nAll good things must come to an end, however. The renaissance ended abruptly with the outbreak of the Great Depression, and despite the best efforts of Kiara and her supporters, the economic downturn has replaced the prosperity of before. The anti parties, driven into exile after the 1920 coup, are festering once more. The failure of the LHS to assist in recovery too has shaken Kiara's faith in Yagooism as a new nationalist movement seeks to include Kiara at its center rather than on the sidelines. By 1936, Kiara must tread all these variable forces as she tries to navigate out of the oncoming firestorm."
