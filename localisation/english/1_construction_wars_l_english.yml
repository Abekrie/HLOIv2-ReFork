 investment.1.t: "Our Investment Pocketed"

 investment.1.a: "Who cares really"

 investment.2.t: "Clash of the Kensetsu"
 investment.2.d: "It seems that a rival Kensetsu has set their eyes on a country we've been pouring resources into. The locals' loyalies have been divided between their Kensetsu and ours, while our contractors have begun low intensity fighting with theirs.

However, making a show of force could escalate the conflict..."

 investment.3.d: "Due to escalated conflicting interests between the three largest construction companies in the world, contract troops of Usada Kensetsu, Oozora Kensetsu, and Akukin Kensetsu have begun open combat in various countries that these construction companies invested in, which in turn has pulled in their mother countries to the conflict. While this is a war between the companies and their mother countries, it is unknown if the LHS or Resistance will be pulled into this conflict."
