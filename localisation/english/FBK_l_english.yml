FBK_shirakami_fubuki: "Shirakami Fubuki"
FBK_shirakami_fubuki_desc: "The proclaimed “Queen of the North”, Shirakami Fubuki is the reigning monarch of Scandinavia. Ruling an empire spanning from Norway to the Russian far north, Fubuki has risen to become one of the most powerful idols in the world with a strong and loyal empire at her disposal.\n\nFubuki started her new life in Finland, then part of the Russian Empire. Disguising herself as a male Baltic-German noble, Fubuki climbed the social hierarchy which got her acquainted with the Finnish populace and nobility, including numerous Pan-Swedish organizations. Later she enlisted in the Imperial Russian Army as an officer. Serving with distinction across numerous campaigns, Fubuki would then be deployed to Galicia upon the outbreak of the Great War. However after numerous defeats and casualties, she resigned from the army. Upon her return to Finland, Fubuki would become more involved in politics, advocating for Finnish independence. When Russia descended into civil war, Fubuki used the opportunity to help Finland gain independence from Russia, however Finland itself fell into chaos. With the help of Mannerheim, Fubuki would defeat the Reds, securing Finland. After this Finland would unify with Sweden thanks to Fubuki's Pan-Swedish allies. Fubuki would then lead her newly formed shock troops, the White Fox Army, into Russia, conquering territory for Finland.\n\nFollowing unification, Fubuki would usurp Gustav V, taking the Swedish throne for herself before leading her forces into Norway and Denmark, uniting Scandinavia under her rule. Her popularity among the people soared as she brought prosperity to Scandinavia thanks to her reforms and free trade. However following rumors of a coup, the elite WFA was exiled to Norway, though still under her control formally. Fubuki's greatest test came in 1932 during the Great Northern War. Fubuki's soldiers and the WFA suffered heavy losses at the hands of Noel's armies, with the war ending in a status-quo antebellum. Recovering from the Northern War, Fubuki must tend to her nation's wounds, as well as the ever increasing instability within the WFA in order for her to maintain her vast northern empire."

  great_depression_fubuki: "Great Depression: Fubuki"
  great_depression_fubuki_desc: "As many economists in Stockholm had predicted, the slump in demand of goods worldwide due to the Great Depression had severely dampened the already ailing economy. Theoretically, stimulous measures would have been the most ideal option but with an unstable political situation dominated by military affairs, additional funding for spending programs would tremendously worsen the existing debt crisis and would require budget cuts for the military; a seemingly absurd proposal."
  white_fox_army: "White Fox Army"
  white_fox_army_desc: "The White Fox Army was formed primarily out of the 2nd and 4th Jaeger Brigades which had fought with Fubuki in the Finnish Civil War (May-December 1916). What originally was just an army group to defeat whatever Russian resistance remained in the Northern tundras became the instrumental force in exerting Fubuki's influence on the Finnish and later Swedish government. However to keep this army loyal , high pay and political positions had to be handed out to all ranks."
  russian_oblasts: "The Oblast Arrangement"
  russian_oblasts_desc: "Once the Treaty of Brugg was signed in 1920, Fubuki remained in control with vast swaths of territory in the former lands of the Russian Empire. With the only other alternative being extreme political unrest, a system of indirect rule was established where each region would elect a council with higher autonomy than other territories within the country. However, this system soon backfired as these councils held much sympathy for local Russian remnant rebel cells. Despite constant pushes to do away with the system, Russian volunteer soldiers were necessary to retain order not only in the oblasts, but in the home territories of Scandinavia. Thus, a careful balance needed to be made in order to prevent any coorperation between the Russian and Scandinavian rebels. With Fubuki now in absolute control, she looks to finally reform the Oblast arrangements."
