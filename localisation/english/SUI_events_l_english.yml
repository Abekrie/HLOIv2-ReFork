#Suisei Election

holo_elections.1.d: "In order to decide the fate of her country, Suisei has called for snap elections to commence. Already people are lining up at their nearest polling stations, and casting their votes to determine which party shall take office."
holo_elections.1.a: "It's so exciting!"

holo_elections.2.t: "Election Violence!"
holo_elections.2.d: "It seems that the calling for snap elections has revealed just how divided along political lines our society is. Across the country, we are getting reports of political protests and rallies being disrupted by radical groups, as well as other instances of violence as a result of political divisions."
holo_elections.2.a: "It's evidently the fault of the conservatives..."
holo_elections.2.b: "It's evidently the fault of the nationalists..."

holo_elections.5.t: "Nationalist Landslide!"
holo_elections.5.d: "To the surprise of some, the nationalists have gained a major victory in the elections. With their support of Aqua's resistance and opposition for Yagoo's policies, many wonder on what their ascension to power will mean for the nation and its relationship with the LHS."
holo_elections.5.a: "I guess people prefered the old government..."

holo_elections.6.t: "Resistance Coalition!"
holo_elections.6.d: "Shocking news in the political arena. A coalition between the leftwing Revolutionaries and rightwing Nationalist parties has been formed.

holo_elections.10.t: "Monarchist Coalition!"
holo_elections.10.d: "In a shocking turn of events, the pro-monarchist elements have formed a coalition government.

Now, the queen, Suisei, finds herself with more power than she did since the rise of the Conservatives."
holo_elections.10.a: "Vive la Reine!"

holo_elections.11.t: "Leading Coalition Partner?"
holo_elections.11.d: "As Suisei finds herself once again in control of her nation's fate, she must decide on which Coalition partner will lead the country."

holo_elections.11.b: "The Resistance is the way forward"
holo_elections.11.c: "Bipartisan politics? Not in La Reine's regime!"

#Starting events

suisei.1.a: "This is stupid"

suisei.2.t: "Progressive Surge"
suisei.2.d: "Within the political arena, there has been a surge of support for the progressive deals of the Coalition Uni de Travailleurs.

suisei.2.a: "Vive les Travailleurs!"

suisei.3.t: "Parlimentarian Scandal"
suisei.3.d: "For the past 17 years since the revolution, Suisei had led her territories in the South of France and abroad. While many know her as the paramilitary leader crowned Empress, few knew of her past prior to her ascension of power. An anonymous source had leaked records and statements, claiming that Suisei had once led a gang that committed various crimes including racketeering and theft. All this after her release in 1910 for her previous crimes. When asked about this, the Empress merely said, “so I was a criminal in my past life. What happened then is irrelevant."
suisei.3.a: "Seriously?"

suisei.4.t: "Royalist Surge"
suisei.4.d: "The vast popularity Suisei has gotten over the years has culminated in increased support for her to regain more power as queen. Although opposed by many political parties apart from the monarchists, the surge in monarchist sentiment is something that simply cannot be ignored by the other parties."
suisei.4.a: "Vive Suisei la Reine!"

suisei.5.t: "Formation of the Society for Suisei"
suisei.5.d: "In order to spread the word and appreciation of our beloved Reine, a society dedicated solely to her has been formed. Not only have they begun making art and films to honour her, but members of the Society for Suisei have begun travelling beyond our borders, to spread their message world wide."
suisei.5.a: "Now even those abroad will know of our oshi!"

suisei.6.t: "France Issues Diplomatic Protest"
suisei.6.d: "Our recent actions have drawn the attention of our rivals to the north. As a result, the government in Paris has issued a diplomatic protest. We can either give into their demands, or hold our ground."
suisei.6.a: "Give into their demands"
suisei.6.b: "We will not let a false nation dictate our policies!"

suisei.7.t: "Yagoo Demands Withdrawal from France"
suisei.7.d: "As our armies push north towards Paris, Yagoo and a number of LHS countries have been alarmed by our aggression. As a result, they have demanded that we withdraw from France, ending the war as quickly as possible."
suisei.7.a: "Capitulate to demands"
suisei.7.b: "Never! We shall be whole again!"

suisei.8.t: "Strikes!"
suisei.8.d: "The strain on our economy has become too much to bear resulting in workers nationwide to go out on strike. As a result, our economy has gone into a standstill, and will remain so until we can end the strikes."
suisei.8.a: "Merde!"

suisei.9.t: "The French Resistance Strikes"
suisei.9.d: "Ever since the division of France, there have been elements within our country that have dedicated themselves to reuniting with the rest of France. Now, due to recent events, we have seen an escalation in activity from the French Resistance, hoping to disrupt the country and reunite with the north"
suisei.9.a: "We need to organise a crackdown"
suisei.9.b: "Bah, free speech is more important than a few thugs"

suisei.10.t: "LHS Investment Offer"
suisei.10.d: "The LHS has offered to financially invest in our country. While this will boost our economy, pro-resistance elements in our country fervently oppose the deal."
suisei.10.a: "We gladly accept"
suisei.10.b: "Merde, we are fine on our own!"

suisei.25.t: "The Question of La Reine"
suisei.25.d: "Many within Parliament have begun questioning the role La Reine must play within our country. Some say that she remains as a figurehead, while her advisors and parliament do most of the work, while others have suggested more extreme measures. Left-wing elements say she should have her position of monarchy abolished, while the royalists demand she be given more power over the government."
suisei.25.a: "An interesting idea..."

#Suisei Strikes#
suisei_deal_with_strikes: "Deal with §SStrikers§!"
suisei_deal_with_strikes_desc: "Cities all around Southern France are in gridlock as people who have recently lost their jobs to the depression have taken to the streets to protest the government's inaction. We have the option of dispersing them here and now but that is likely to be extremely unpopular, result in a rise of French Resistance and likely lose us our position in parliament."
suisei.11.t: "The Strikes Continue!"
suisei.11.d: "Despite our negotiations, the Strikers still refuse to return to work, making more demands before fully being ready to end the strike"
suisei.11.a: "Negotiations will continue regardless!"

suisei.13.t: "The Strikers Push for One More Demand!"
suisei.13.d: "Just as negotiations were making a breakthrough, the strikers have made one more demand before agreeing to our terms."
suisei.13.a: "If it gets them back into the workplace..."
suisei.13.b: "Enough of this nonsense. Call in the army!"

suisei.14.t: "The Protests Die Down"
suisei.14.d: "We have finally reached a breakthrough with the strikers. In return for safer working conditions, reasonable hours, and decent pay, they will be returning to their jobs. Many within the government, particularly the Socialists and Revolutionaries see this as a victory for the common workers."
suisei.14.a: "Finally"

suisei.15.t: "Aftermath of the Riots"
suisei.15.d: "After negotiations with the strikers fail, the army has been called in to assist the police in breaking up the strikes. After days of intense violence, the strikes are now over. However, while some praise order being restored, many within parliament and ordinary citizens have criticised the government for violently cracking down on simple calls for better working conditions. Left-leaning parties in particular believe that this was an abuse of power."
suisei.15.a: "Merde..."

suisei.16.t: "Looting and Rioting!"
suisei.16.d: "The strikes have now devolved into widespread riots and looting across nearly all major cities across the country. As police deal with them as best to their ability, members of the government are demanding action be taken. "
suisei.16.a: "Let's hope it doesn't get worse"

suisei.18.t: "Utilize §PRoyal Powers?§!"
suisei.18.d: "As chaos grips the country, more and more people as well as members of parliament are pleading for Suisei to use her royal powers and intervene, and hopefully end the chaos. However, some criticise this motion, saying that it will bring an end to democracy for the sake of putting an end to the riots across the country."
suisei.18.a: "Of course! Allons Suisei!"
suisei.18.b: "§lDemocracy§! will not die in France!"

suisei.19.t: "À Où?"
suisei.19.d: "A"
suisei.19.a: "Needless to say, the §dLHS§! has supported us depite our recent troubles."
suisei.19.b: "Aqua's §DResistance§! is the way of the future..."
suisei.19.c: "Partisan politics?! Dans le pays de §Pla Reine§!!?"

suisei.20.t: "Reuniting With Brothers"
suisei.20.d: "With the end of the idol Suisei's reign, many within our country now demand that we reunite with the rest of our French brothers to the north."
suisei.20.a: "Is this even a question?"
suisei.20.b: "Non! Les fronts noir and bleus have abandoned us!"

suisei.21.t: "The Protectorate of Algeria declares independence!"
suisei.21.d: "We have recently got word that the Protectorate of Algeria has declared independence from us. Being our prized colony, many have been shocked as a result of Algeria leaving our empire, and many are demanding action being taken."
suisei.21.a: "We have bigger fish to fry..."
suisei.21.b: "We'll be back before they know it."

suisei.22.t: "The Algerian Question?"
suisei.22.d: "Ever since Algeria declared independence, many from average citizens to high ranking members of parliament have wondered what should be done."
suisei.22.a: "What are you waiting for?! Attack!"
suisei.22.b: "Another War? I'd rather an amical relationship."

suisei.23.t: "Our Southern Brothers Request Annexation"
suisei.23.d: "Ever since the idol who proclaimed herself queen of the south was overthrown, many speculate what would happen to her former kingdom. We now have gotten a message from there, as the antis who overthrew Suisei ask that we annex the Southern regions, reuniting France as a result."
suisei.23.a: "Is this a question? Of course let them in!"
suisei.23.b: "Communism is a greater threat than the LHS!"

suisei.24.t: "Our Northern Brothers Accept!"
suisei.24.d: "Wonderful news! Our brothers in the north have accepted our request for annexation. Now, France will be whole again!"
suisei.24.a: "Of Course? Why wouldn't they?"

suisei.25.t: "Rise of Monarchist Sentiment"
suisei.25.d: "A"
suisei.25.a: "Excéllent"

suisei.26.t: "Progressive-Conservative Coalition Shatters"
suisei.26.d: "Divisions within the coalition proved to be too great for all parties. As a result, the coalition has completely dissolved, with both the Conservatives and Progressive factions going about their separate ways once more."
suisei.26.a: "Merde!"

suisei.27.t: "End of the Depression?"
suisei.27.d: "With our economic situation improving, many within the government believe the economic depression is now over. While some are willing to move onto more pressing issues, others within parliament believe that we should change our economy to lessen the effects of another depression."
suisei.27.a: "Proof capitalism isn't at fault"

suisei.28.t: "Budget Proposals - Day 1"
suisei.28.d: "The drafting of new reforms to our economic budget has begun. First on the to-do list is a new proposal on reforming our healthcare and education system.

suisei.28.a: "Healthcare and Education are rights!"
suisei.28.b: "Surely the conservatives see the benefits of a bit of spending?"
suisei.28.c: "We don't want to anger our coalition partners..."

suisei.29.t: "Budget Proposals - Day 2"
suisei.29.d: "Day 2 of the new budget proposals. Now comes a more controversial subject in the form of expanding our country's military. While some, mainly the pro-LHS parties advocate for us to either remain neutral in global affairs or to abide by the Brugg Treaty, while Pro-resistance parties advocate for expansion, regardless of if they abide by the Brugg treaty or not."
suisei.29.a: "We agree, it's a dangerous world after all..."
suisei.29.b: "The limitations set by Brugg are a good standard"
suisei.29.c: "Sacrébleu! We are pacifists at heart!"

suisei.30.t: "Budget Proposals - Day 3"
suisei.30.d: "Final day of the budget proposals, and what needs to be discussed is a way to help cope with the effects of the depression. Some parties, mainly those who are conservative say that no intervention should be taken, or for only limited programs to be implemented, while other parties call for a full stimulus package."
suisei.30.a: "Stimulous is the way out of the depression!"
suisei.30.b: "Small programs are sufficient"

suisei.31.t: "The Budget is Drafted!"

suisei.31.a: "Hopefully we won't start a riot..."

suisei.32.t: "Anger from the Right!"
suisei.32.d: "Unfortunately it seems that the new budget has drawn the anger from many right leaning and conservative groups, who believe the new budget is too left leaning. Already protests have erupted in the streets, demanding for the budget to be changed."
suisei.32.a: "Damn Conservatives!"

suisei.33.t: "Agreement from All Sides!"
suisei.33.d: "To the surprise of many, it seems that everyone on the political spectrum, conservative, socialist, nationalist and monarchist has agreed with the policies of the recent budget"
suisei.33.a: "A win for the government!"

suisei.34.t: "Pinacle of the Enlightened Monarch"
suisei.34.d: "Although many feared reprisal for suggesting Suisei's power be limited or removed entirely, to the surprise of many, La Reine Suisei has allowed many of the opposing parties to remain, and she has even gone as far as to allow some members of parliament from different parties to maintain their positions."
suisei.34.a: "Rule through respect, not force"

suisei.35.t: "White Terror"
suisei.35.d: "Unfortunately it seems the fears of many politicians have come true as in order to ensure the security of our country's people and La Reine, a systematic purge has begun of all enemies of La Reine Suisei. Already, we have begun dismissing rival politicians from parliament, and our police are out hunting supposed enemies among our citizenry."
suisei.35.a: "Only la Reine shall rule!"

suisei.36.t: "Resistance Supporters Defect"
suisei.36.d: "Our policies seemed to have angered pro-resistance elements within our country. As a result, many have fled abroad, defecting to more friendly nations world wide."
suisei.36.a: "Damn!"

suisei.37.t: "Anger from our Supporters!"
suisei.37.d: "Dissent among our own supporters has been steadily growing thanks to our recent policies. As our popularity among the ordinary people wanes, our government is preparing for more civil unrest, should things escalate."

suisei.79.t: "Policy with Miko"

suisei.41.t: "Italian Rebels"

suisei.42.t: "Swiss Rebels"
suisei.42.d: "News from the tall and rugged mountains of Switzerland. Our garrisons have been attacked, and infrastructure around the country has been sabotaged, making our efforts to traverse and control the region even more difficult."

suisei.50.t: "Revolutionary Reforms Succeed"
