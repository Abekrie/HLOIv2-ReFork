watson.1.t:0 "King George V has died!"
watson.1.d:0 "While a divisive figure in the eyes of many, the previous King of the British Empire, George V, has peacefully passed away in his sleep. After his abdication of the throne, for which Watson is now the regent, the older man settled into his title as the Duke of Windsor. There was little any opposition to the old monarchy could do, for he was largely protected by aristocratic elements of the National Teammate Front. \n \n So George V withdrew from public life, resigning himself to a comfortable and peaceful retirement in his estates, primarily the Windsor castle. This self-imposed political and public exile was a thing rarely broken, save for appearances at the Wimbledon Tennis Championship and a few other occasions. The Duke's chief physician, Lord Dawson of Penn, said only that, “The Duke's life is moving peacefully towards its close.” and remarked further that the Duke had passed.” When word was brought to Watson all the regent had to say was:"
watson.1.a:0 "“A good man, a great tragedy.”"
watson.1.b:0 "“Good Riddance!”"
watson.1.c:0 "“Who?”"

watson.2.t:0 "Antarctic Expedition Returns!"
watson.2.d:0 "Brave and daring Teammate explorers have returned from their Graham Land Expedition! The survey team privately volunteered to explore the distant, icy wasteland; setting off in the year 1934. They received small scientific grants from the Watson administration, specifically from the London Geographical Society and the Colonial Office. A lesser amount of money came from private sponsors and drives. The expedition used these scant funds to purchase an old three masted ship, the majority of the being remarkable volunteers all opting out of pay in order to pursue this admirable goal. \n \n  The expedition was a remarkable success, thanks in large part to the use of experienced sled dogs and aerial survey by biplane. The biplane (model de Havilland Fox Moth), piloted primarily by second-in-command and chief pilot W.E Hampton, proved to be a key figure in the expedition, their aerial reconnaissance being important in determining that the Graham Land is a peninsula, not an island. Hampton has been hired into the Teammate air force as an advisor, his experience in difficult weather conditions and aerial scouting solidifying his role."
watson.2.a:0 "Quite impressive, what can we learn?"

watson.3.t:0 "Disaster at Holditch Colliery"
watson.3.d:0 "As the black smoke rose over Staffordshire, wives wept and children mourned, for a terrible disaster had befallen the workers of Holditch Coal Mine. It initially began with a fire in the lower reaches of the mines that was quickly detected by miners Herman Payne and William Beardmore. The two miners alerted the crew of the dangers below. This fire spread rapidly, and threatened the lives of the 55 miners who were inside. The bold and daring crew gathered their gear and rallied to fend off the fires that were crawling up from the depths. \n \n  However valiantly the crew fought, the fire seemed to be undefeatable. Mr. John Davies, a manager of the mine, drafted a plan, one which would have been successful in containing the fire and the firedamp (flammable gas) explosions. His plan called for the erecting of two stopping dams in stable ground that was closer to the entrance, which stifled the fires air flow and made it so material could be brought quicker. However upon the arrival of Mr. John Cocks, managing director of the mine, the plan was changed. This new plan called for erecting three dams in unstable ground. This was further from the entrance which resulted in material being brought in slower while also allowing air and fuel to flow to the fire. This was done in order to protect the coal reserves underground from being consumed in the fire, which would have hampered profits. Due to this gross failure by management, 30 people have perished and 8 were severely wounded. Now the people of England look to see what Watson will do."
watson.3.a:0 "Let us aid in the cleanup efforts."
watson.3.b:0 "We must reprimand Management!"
watson.3.c:0 "The workers should have been more careful."

watson.10.t:0 "The Establishment of the BBC Television Service"
watson.10.d:0 "After the Great War, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was created by Amelia Watson to bring order and stability over the messy post-war landscape by allowing the population to be more informed on the happenings of the nation. However, the BBC had primarily conducted its programming in radio form. Nonetheless, plans had been in the works for a while to bring an expansion of the BBC into the newly burgeoning television market, and today it has finally been established as the BBC Television Service. \n \n Of course, what remains now is what the main focus of its television programs should be. To that end, Watson has identified three ways for the BC Television Service to function. Firstly, as the BBC is state-owned, it could be focused on stabilising and promoting the current regime. Secondly, Watson could allow for the BBC Television Service to adopt a more neutral stance on the various issues of the country, to foster the development of democracy. A third option is to make it an entertainment channel primarily, leaving the news programmes to be covered by the radio. This new venture would then help in entertaining and raising the spirits of the British people, as well as honouring a particular patron of Watson. \n \n After a long period of thinking on which direction to choose, Watson finally decided that:"

watson.10.a:0 "State-owned means state-run, glory to me!"
watson.10.b:0 "Let’s give the old “freedom of speech” a try, make it neutral."
watson.10.c:0 "Baker Street better than Cable Street, innit? Let's bring entertainment to the masses."

watson.11.t:0 "Foundation of the Women’s Voluntary Service"
watson.11.d:0 "While the origins of Amelia Watson are unknown, her first publicly known appearance was as a combat medic and nurse in the Second Boer War. Due to her efforts in that war, she was awarded the Order of Merit. \n \n Thanks to these services, it is perhaps no surprise that it was Watson who proposed the idea of the Women’s Voluntary Service. This would be an extended section of the existing Civil Defense Service, whose duty is to prepare the British population from any threats and assist them if need be. Given the deteriorating geopolitical situation, everyone, including women, would need to play their part to prepare for a future conflict. Many observers, including various progressive factions in the country, applaud the service’s founding, noting that it could lead to further developments in gender equality."
watson.11.a:0 "Now everyone can do their part!"

watson.12.t:0 "Freud Arrives in London”
watson.12.d:0 "The famous psychiatrist Sigmund Freud has moved to London today, seeking to escape from the chaos that was destabilising his homeland. Freud believed it was time to move to somewhere much more stable, at least compared to other parts of Europe. \n \n While he is publicly known as the father of psychoanalysis, privately Freud has been infamous for his controversial comments on human nature. In fact, it is already an open secret that the only thing that can match Freud's drive to study the human psyche is his rampant libido towards mature women. Of course, with the entrance of such an infamous figure, Watson faces a conundrum; after all, rumour has it that she also has similar interests…"
watson.12.a:0 "We have to contain Freud, he might stea--- I mean harm the mothers of this country!"
watson.12.b:0 "We clearly have common interests, how about cooperating on some… mutually beneficial matters?"

watson.4.t:0 "Nobel Prize Award Ceremony"
watson.4.d:0 "The “Nobel Prizes” are awarded annually by a Swedish committee to those who have made outstanding contributions in the fields of Chemistry, Physics, Literature, Peace, and Medicine. This particular year would see the success of many Englishmen, those being - Robert Cecil in the Peace Prize “for his tireless effort in garnering support for the LHS, and making sure that the Kingdom of Watson put the LHS at the centre of its foreign policy.”, a joint win of the Physics Prize for George Thomson “for experimental discovery of the diffraction of electrons by crystals.”, and a split victory for the Chemistry Prize by Walter Haworth “for his investigations into carbohydrates and vitamin C.”"
watson.4.a:0 "“Yaay! Congratulations!”"
watson.4.b:0 "“Peace?! The only one here keeping the peace is your rightful ruler! REEEEEEE!”"
watson.4.c:0 "“Any further discoveries in Physics will still have to bow down to the power of Time Travel!”"
watson.4.e:0 "“The Watson Concoction incorporated those vitamins long ago, helping to save many lives...”"

watson.5.t:0 "The 10th Anniversary of the Death of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle"
watson.5.d:0 "On the 7th of July 1930 exactly 10 years ago, we saw the death of one of the most remarkable authors in the world. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle famously wrote the crime fiction stories of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. With a total of four novels and fifty-six short stories, “Sherlock” would quickly become a cornerstone of English culture and appreciated by many for decades to come. Lesser known and appreciated however is Doyle’s superb medical career, something he would later incorporate into his stories giving them a sense of realism the likes of which other authors could only dream of. During Amelia Watson’s initial time as a nurse in colonial South Africa, she was lucky enough to meet Sir Doyle while he was volunteering as a doctor during the Second Boer War. Although much could be speculated about their conversation, one can only assume they at least took part in each other’s shared passions of science and literature."
watson.5.a:0 "“Without this great man I could not be standing before you all today...”"
watson.5.b:0 "“It is only when one flame dies out, that another can burn brighter!”"

watson.6.t:0 "Strikes Continue in London!"
watson.6.d:0 "Today marks the third week of London’s Bus and Rail strikes which have caused a considerable loss in earnings for the nation. Compared to the corresponding week of last-year, a total decrease of 144,400 pounds has been reported. Although the executive council of the union has forbidden an extension of the strike into next month, it has now been estimated that even when regular transport services do return that usual income may not come alongside it. This is due to Londoners having now grown accustomed to walking the short distances over which they previously rode, and thus the general public has overall less reliance on public transport."
watson.6.a:0 "“The Teammates deserve better working conditions and wages...”"
watson.6.b:0 "“I don't want to see even a single strike on my watch!”"

watson.13.t:0 "The Nation is in Flames"
watson.13.d:0 "Following the failure of LHS coalition to crush the Revolutions of 1931, nationalist groups from Londonderry to Kent have actively been working to destabilize the country through acts of insurrection. The three most notable groups include: the pro-Irish Unification Irish Republican Army, the pro-Welsh succession Byddin Gweriniaeth Cymru and the anti-Watson English Antis. Although appearing to be a united front, these organisations only exist on paper as they are plagued by factionalism, in-fighting and splinter groups. Despite this, they still prove to be a major thorn in the side of Watson's England."

watson.28.t:0 "The Anti Question"
watson.28.d:0 "Watson, though a popular figure among many, has made an equally many number of enemies and opponents. As regent she made enemies of the §Onationalists§! throughout Britannia, who rose against the regime in open rebellion. §ORebels§! throughout our home islands will never do. We must reunite our homeland and restore peace to the British Isles, bringing them all back into the fold of the §dHololive order§!. Whichever we regain first doesn’t matter, but we must restore Great Britain as well as stabilise the chaotic island of Ireland. \n\nThe only question that remains is how shall we go about this? To defeat the §OScottish and English Nationalists§!, we need some major form of support, a trump card which will give us an edge over the enemy. Our main option will likely be support from the §lLHS§! or a §dHololive-affiliated§! nation, but in the event that our requests are refused by whomever we ask it would hamper our cause and appearance. On the other hand, Ireland is an entirely different beast, for Ireland was split in parts after the revolts. There are two main routes to fixing the Ireland problem, for the situation cannot stay as it is. We can either return §dNorthern Ireland to the people of the island§!, so that there is no longer need for fighting; or we must forge a new solution to fix the problems the §YTreaty of Brugg§! created. \n\nNo matter the demands of some §Orebels§!, we are the rightful ruler of Great Britain. We shall no longer bear the shame of our failure to defeat the §Onationalists§!, and we shall make the world recognize our greatness. We will rally the people of these once §PUnited Kingdoms§! to this cause, and proudly proclaim with all our might that we shall lead the §lreconquista§! of these isles!"
watson.28.a:0 "Let 'Rule Britannia' be more than just a phrase!"

watson.29.t:0 "The Easter Crisis"
watson.29.d:0 "Since autumn of last year, the government has been in a fierce internal debate regarding the allocation of the budget. This year marks the first instance of economic growth since the depression began, and many factions within the §dWatson government§! have been vying for control of the funding. Weeks have gone by since with little agreement having been reached. As the end of the fiscal year, April 5th, approaches, the government is obligated to have approved the next year's budget by then. Should a consensus not be reached, a vote of no confidence is almost guaranteed, which would oust the current §dWatson regime§!. Watson has withdrawn to her cabinet in a private meeting, and two plans have been outlined by the cabinet. \n\nThe first is the §dconventional§! path, one of compromise with our opposition. This is sadly the nature of a §dparliamentary government§!, where differing parties must resolve their problems by aligning and working together. Should we concede on some of the points they're calling for, we would be able to pass most of the budget we want. The majority of §dWatson supporters§! would be understanding of this, however some of the far §Pextremists§! may prove unwilling to cede any political ground to the opposition. \n\nThe alternative is quite unprecedented. The §dWestminster system§! we use does not specify the exact course of action should a budget be unresolved. Citing loopholes and the need for drastic action in face of a budgetary failure, Watson could force a new budget through the parliament without a majority vote. This would outrage much of the opposition and even alienate some of the less devoted members of §dWatson's supporters§!. The more fervent and extreme followers of Watson, however, would support this move as the only way to push through a needed budget. \n\nTwo opposed and irreconcilable paths lay before the regent Watson, and whichever decision she moves forward with will decide the future of this proud nation. Watson can fully accept her role as an §dequal to the parliament§! or she may grasp greater executive authority within her hands. The latter is a road she must walk carefully, lest this power corrupt Watson. So make your decision wisely, detective, the fate of Britannia rests on your shoulders."
watson.29.a:0 "The rules were devised by us, we must follow them."
watson.29.b:0 "We devised the rules, why not bend them?"

watson.33.t:0 "A New Goverment"
watson.33.d:0 "Watson, with Britain behind, stands at a crossroads, one that will forever change the entire island’s fate. Watson is presented with two plans by her cabinet, one to preserve §ddemocracy and the parliament§!, and the other to exploit a loophole in the law and completely centralise power. Watson mulled over the options, but she distrusted the second option, for she believed in the power of §ddemocracy and in the parliament§!. \nAfter much debate between the two groups, she had finally decided. The people, whether of the §dworking class§! or the §Oextreme nationalists§!, would never support such a power grab. Centralising power was a one-way ticket to political disaster, and if not that, a dictatorship. \n\nShe would not repeat the mistakes of the old §Proyalty§!. \n\nShe would form a new §dcoalition government§!, similar to the §dold parliament§!, and lead all the isles towards the path of §dtrue democracy§!. With the plan now established, all that’s left is to set it in motion!”"
watson.33.a:0 "We created the rules, and we shall adhere to them."
    
watson.34.t:0 "The Westminster Constitution"
watson.34.d:0 "Everyday the government comes closer to collapse. Those in the political centre are strained and strained, being pulled apart to the fringes; the centre cannot hold, and the §dgovernment as we know it§! may soon shatter with it. No budget has been reached in the past days, and no faction can claw themselves to victory, able to pass the budget they deem as ‘necessary for the country's future’. \nWatson will not let this country fall, not under any circumstances. The §dcurrent Westminster system§! is outdated, it needs to be amended, modernised. Watson, in coordination with her cabinet, has drafted a revision to the §dWestminster system§!. Her faction has dubbed it the §SWestminster Constitution§!. \nThis amendment would give greater influence to the executive branch, giving the Regent power over the parliament. This would certainly give Watsons faction the sheer authority and power they would need. This will, however, shake the nation, and severely weaken the people's §dfaith in their government§!. Should Watson fail, or even become overambitious, it may be the spark that detonates the government, spiralling into chaos and unrest. \nWatson is confident, though, that she can walk that line, and with the greater powers of her position, she will be able to do what is best for Britain. With the backing of the §dteammates§!, there is nothing we cannot do!"
watson.34.a:0 "We will move forward, and do as we must."
