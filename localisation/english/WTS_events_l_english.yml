watson.1.t: "King George V has died!"
watson.1.d: "While a divisive figure in the eyes of many, the previous King of the British Empire, George V, has peacefully passed away in his sleep. After his abdication of the throne, for which Watson is now the regent, the older man settled into his title as the Duke of Windsor. There was little any opposition to the old monarchy could do, for he was largely protected by aristocratic elements of the National Teammate Front. \n \n So George V withdrew from public life, resigning himself to a comfortable and peaceful retirement in his estates, primarily the Windsor castle. This self-imposed political and public exile was a thing rarely broken, save for appearances at the Wimbledon Tennis Championship and a few other occasions. The Duke's chief physician, Lord Dawson of Penn, said only that, “The Duke's life is moving peacefully towards its close.” and remarked further that the Duke had passed.” When word was brought to Watson all the regent had to say was:"
watson.1.a: "“A good man, a great tragedy.”"
watson.1.b: "“Good Riddance!”"
watson.1.c: "“Who?”"

watson.2.t: "Antarctic Expedition Returns!"
watson.2.d: "Brave and daring Teammate explorers have returned from their Graham Land Expedition! The survey team privately volunteered to explore the distant, icy wasteland; setting off in the year 1934. They received small scientific grants from the Watson administration, specifically from the London Geographical Society and the Colonial Office. A lesser amount of money came from private sponsors and drives. The expedition used these scant funds to purchase an old three masted ship, the majority of the being remarkable volunteers all opting out of pay in order to pursue this admirable goal. \n \n  The expedition was a remarkable success, thanks in large part to the use of experienced sled dogs and aerial survey by biplane. The biplane (model de Havilland Fox Moth), piloted primarily by second-in-command and chief pilot W.E Hampton, proved to be a key figure in the expedition, their aerial reconnaissance being important in determining that the Graham Land is a peninsula, not an island. Hampton has been hired into the Teammate air force as an advisor, his experience in difficult weather conditions and aerial scouting solidifying his role."
watson.2.a: "Quite impressive, what can we learn?"

watson.3.t: "Disaster at Holditch Colliery"
watson.3.d: "As the black smoke rose over Staffordshire, wives wept and children mourned, for a terrible disaster had befallen the workers of Holditch Coal Mine. It initially began with a fire in the lower reaches of the mines that was quickly detected by miners Herman Payne and William Beardmore. The two miners alerted the crew of the dangers below. This fire spread rapidly, and threatened the lives of the 55 miners who were inside. The bold and daring crew gathered their gear and rallied to fend off the fires that were crawling up from the depths. \n \n  However valiantly the crew fought, the fire seemed to be undefeatable. Mr. John Davies, a manager of the mine, drafted a plan, one which would have been successful in containing the fire and the firedamp (flammable gas) explosions. His plan called for the erecting of two stopping dams in stable ground that was closer to the entrance, which stifled the fires air flow and made it so material could be brought quicker. However upon the arrival of Mr. John Cocks, managing director of the mine, the plan was changed. This new plan called for erecting three dams in unstable ground. This was further from the entrance which resulted in material being brought in slower while also allowing air and fuel to flow to the fire. This was done in order to protect the coal reserves underground from being consumed in the fire, which would have hampered profits. Due to this gross failure by management, 30 people have perished and 8 were severely wounded. Now the people of England look to see what Watson will do."
watson.3.a: "Let us aid in the cleanup efforts."
watson.3.b: "We must reprimand Management!"
watson.3.c: "The workers should have been more careful."

watson.4.t: "Nobel Prize Award Ceremony"
watson.4.d: "The “Nobel Prizes” are awarded annually by a Swedish committee to those who have made outstanding contributions in the fields of Chemistry, Physics, Literature, Peace, and Medicine. This particular year would see the success of many Englishmen, those being - Robert Cecil in the Peace Prize “for his tireless effort in garnering support for the LHS, and making sure that the Kingdom of Watson put the LHS at the centre of its foreign policy.”, a joint win of the Physics Prize for George Thomson “for experimental discovery of the diffraction of electrons by crystals.”, and a split victory for the Chemistry Prize by Walter Haworth “for his investigations into carbohydrates and vitamin C.”"
watson.4.a: "“Yaay! Congratulations!”"
watson.4.b: "“Peace?! The only one here keeping the peace is your rightful ruler! REEEEEEE!”"
watson.4.c: "“Any further discoveries in Physics will still have to bow down to the power of Time Travel!”"
watson.4.e: "“The Watson Concoction incorporated those vitamins long ago, helping to save many lives...”"

watson.5.t: "The 10th Anniversary of the Death of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle"
watson.5.d: "On the 7th of July 1930 exactly 10 years ago, we saw the death of one of the most remarkable authors in the world. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle famously wrote the crime fiction stories of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. With a total of four novels and fifty-six short stories, “Sherlock” would quickly become a cornerstone of English culture and appreciated by many for decades to come. Lesser known and appreciated however is Doyle's superb medical career, something he would later incorporate into his stories giving them a sense of realism the likes of which other authors could only dream of. During Amelia Watson's initial time as a nurse in colonial South Africa, she was lucky enough to meet Sir Doyle while he was volunteering as a doctor during the Second Boer War. Although much could be speculated about their conversation, one can only assume they at least took part in each other's shared passions of science and literature."
watson.5.a: "“Without this great man I could not be standing before you all today...”"
watson.5.b: "“It is only when one flame dies out, that another can burn brighter!”"

watson.6.t: "Strikes Continue in London!"
watson.6.d: "Today marks the third week of London's Bus and Rail strikes which have caused a considerable loss in earnings for the nation. Compared to the corresponding week of last-year, a total decrease of 144,400 pounds has been reported. Although the executive council of the union has forbidden an extension of the strike into next month, it has now been estimated that even when regular transport services do return that usual income may not come alongside it. This is due to Londoners having now grown accustomed to walking the short distances over which they previously rode, and thus the general public has overall less reliance on public transport."
watson.6.a: "“The Teammates deserve better working conditions and wages...”"
watson.6.b: "“I don't want to see even a single strike on my watch!”"

watson.7.t: "Splendid Isolation"
watson.7.d: "Watson stands at the helm of Britain, at the behest of the English people. We have only just recently reunified our home, and cemented our position as a power on the world stage. We shall not yield our self determination and future to a foreign alliance. While the LHS has many supporters throughout Britain, the fact remains that the majority of people have no wish to fight these foreign wars. The Resistance is even less popular in England, a minority that will accept our choice of a different path. Why should English sons be sent across the world, risking life and limb, because some coalition which places their interests first says they must? \n \n England shall devote itself to English affairs first. The first of these matters is our position on the world stage, the growing conflicts and tensions between the LHS and the Resistance. Watson has chosen a solution fitting of Britannia and it's past, isolation. Let these factions squabble, we shall be the third party of neutrality, watching from the sidelines. This is not to say we shall be idle. The present situation is the best chance to restore the colonies since the collapse of the empire, while our old dominion's bicker and fight among themselves. \n \n The Royal Navy, reborn from the ashes, stands tall and alone, a defiant symbol of Britain's rebirth. The English Army, cleansed of decay, is the mightiest force in the isles, the prime force on these isles. The Regent Air Force, birthed of aluminium, soars above our homes, a relentless bird of prey. With all this might we shall show restraint, we shall not disrupt the balance of power in Europe and the world. Britain shall grow strong, focusing on it's own internal affairs, so we can find ourselves ready; ready for England to reclaim its place at the forefront of the world stage."
watson.7.a: "London before all else!"

watson.8.t: "The London Conference"
watson.8.d: "The common man of England has laboured and toiled, striving for the unification of his homeland. Finally we have seen our homeland restored, rebels and pretenders defeated. Watson, ever one for grand spectacle, has arranged large parades and public celebrations throughout the cities of Britain. No price was deemed too large, no detail too small. Watson herself was a chief planner and the guest of honour of the celebrations in London. \n \n The people of London crowd the streets, pushing their way through Trafalgar square. Standing atop the palace balcony, Watson waves to the people below. Once the crowd began to quiet down, Watson began to speak aloud. \n \n “I would like to take a moment to thank everyone here today, whether they listen over the radio or if they are here with me as I speak. So all should know, wherever you may be listening from, I thank you. It is only because of the efforts of our united English people that we have come so far, that we have restored our homeland. Now I will keep this brief, for I know many have their own celebrations and joyous reunions planned for this day. For today we celebrate our victory over the rebels and extremists which threatened us, in their attempt to claw us down to where we stood 20 years ago.” \n \n  “They have failed, though, and now we stand ready to move into a new era of prosperity and fame for England!” Watson paused, reading the crowd's excitement, then continued. “People of London, and of all Britain, I ask you to continue to stand with me, now that we have moved past our darkest days and into a sunny future. I ask no more of you on this day, for let us now enjoy the fruits of our labours, and celebrate our triumph. I am aware that many fathers and sons in our army have been given leave, and shall be returning home from their duty. So I shall take no more time from your joyous reunion, and I pray for your continued happiness. We shall move forward, and celebrate the future that awaits us all! Thank you all for your time.” \n \n Watson bowed her head and waved goodbye to the crowd, listening to their cheers and cries of joy. She turned and walked back into Buckingham palace, out of the eyes of the crowd. The speech had gone well, but she had much more to do for today. She had many public appearances to make, as well as fans and supporters to greet. Watson prepared herself for her busy day, and followed by her bodyguards, pushed open the front door to Buckingham palace and stepped outside, into the bright sunlight."
watson.8.a: "A triumph worthy of Rome."

watson.9.t: "Memories of an Empire"
watson.9.d: "Watson stood at the podium, facing the room of dignitaries and statesmen, the room was full abuzz with energy. The faces looked at Watson, waiting for her to speak; the only people more attentive were the reporters from several media outlets. Watson clinked a spoon upon a glass of water she held up, stilling the room. \n \n “It is a pleasure to see all of you here, and I am honoured to make the acquaintance of so many well-known and respected Teammates. We gather here, of course to celebrate our victory as a nation, one I share with all in this room, and that I owe to so many here. We have finally seen Britain reunited.” Watson paused to gauge the room, then continued. “Our fatherland has seen a decline, in recent years, turmoil has rocked our isles, but now we have steady footing. We must look back, to what was once our vast empire, our holdings across the world which made us the strongest force on the globe, not a mere secondary power.” \n \n The crowd applauded, many of them were the first generation of aristocratic teammates that followed Ame, and many more were the sons of this generation, coming into their age now. They remembered Britain's greatness, and the territories it held. Photographers clambered to Watson left and right, vying for the best angle and shot, their accompanying reporters called out questions, yet all quieted as Watson held up a hand. \n \n “We shall move forward, and reassert our position on the world stage. As we regain control of our dominions we shall reappoint Governor-Generals to the holdings, only the most distinguished and capable will be chosen. It is my hope and plan that many here in this room shall be sent the honourable few to display our greatness.” \n \n The room was sent into applause, shouts of “hear, hear” and “praise be to Watson'' being audible over the clapping. Several volunteers, from renowned families, stood up and proclaimed themselves as willing volunteers. The reporters stepped closer and barraged Watson with questions, over where Britain would go first, and who would be appointed. Watson, ever one for suspense and show, drank slowly from the glass of water on the podium, then upon finishing started to walk off the stage. Accompanied by her bodyguards, she shouted out for the sake of the crowd."
watson.9.a: "For Britannia!"

watson.10.t: "The Establishment of the BBC Television Service"
watson.10.d: "After the Great War, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was created by Amelia Watson to bring order and stability over the messy post-war landscape by allowing the population to be more informed on the happenings of the nation. However, the BBC had primarily conducted its programming in radio form. Nonetheless, plans had been in the works for a while to bring an expansion of the BBC into the newly burgeoning television market, and today it has finally been established as the BBC Television Service. \n \n Of course, what remains now is what the main focus of its television programs should be. To that end, Watson has identified three ways for the BC Television Service to function. Firstly, as the BBC is state-owned, it could be focused on stabilising and promoting the current regime. Secondly, Watson could allow for the BBC Television Service to adopt a more neutral stance on the various issues of the country, to foster the development of democracy. A third option is to make it an entertainment channel primarily, leaving the news programmes to be covered by the radio. This new venture would then help in entertaining and raising the spirits of the British people, as well as honouring a particular patron of Watson. \n \n After a long period of thinking on which direction to choose, Watson finally decided that:"
watson.10.a: "State-owned means state-run, glory to me!"
watson.10.b: "Let's give the old “freedom of speech” a try, make it neutral."
watson.10.c: "Baker Street better than Cable Street, innit? Let's bring entertainment to the masses."

watson.11.t: "Foundation of the Women's Voluntary Service"
watson.11.d: "While the origins of Amelia Watson are unknown, her first publicly known appearance was as a combat medic and nurse in the Second Boer War. Due to her efforts in that war, she was awarded the Order of Merit. \n \n Thanks to these services, it is perhaps no surprise that it was Watson who proposed the idea of the Women's Voluntary Service. This would be an extended section of the existing Civil Defense Service, whose duty is to prepare the British population from any threats and assist them if need be. Given the deteriorating geopolitical situation, everyone, including women, would need to play their part to prepare for a future conflict. Many observers, including various progressive factions in the country, applaud the service's founding, noting that it could lead to further developments in gender equality."
watson.11.a: "Now everyone can do their part!"

watson.12.t: "Freud Arrives in London"
watson.12.d: "The famous psychiatrist Sigmund Freud has moved to London today, seeking to escape from the chaos that was destabilising his homeland. Freud believed it was time to move to somewhere much more stable, at least compared to other parts of Europe. \n \n While he is publicly known as the father of psychoanalysis, privately Freud has been infamous for his controversial comments on human nature. In fact, it is already an open secret that the only thing that can match Freud's drive to study the human psyche is his rampant libido towards mature women. Of course, with the entrance of such an infamous figure, Watson faces a conundrum; after all, rumour has it that she also has similar interests…"
watson.12.a: "We have to contain Freud, he might stea--- I mean harm the mothers of this country!"
watson.12.b: "We clearly have common interests, how about cooperating on some… mutually beneficial matters?"

watson.13.t: "The Nation is in Flames"
watson.13.d: "Following the failure of §dLHS coalition§! to crush §fThe Great English Revolution§! of §y1931§!, §fnationalist groups§! from Londonderry to Kent have actively been working to destabilize the country through acts of insurrection. The three most notable groups include: the §Dpro-Irish unification Irish Republican Army§!, §gthe pro-Welsh successionist Byddin Gweriniaeth Cymru§! and the §fanti-Watson English Antis§!. Although appearing to be a united front, these organisations are plagued by factionalism, in-fighting and splinter groups. Despite this, they still prove to be a major thorn in the side of §dWatson's England.§!"
watson.13.a: "She's still my oshi though..."

watson.14.t: "Northern Ireland Solution
watson.14.d: "Northern Ireland has long been a thorn in the side of Britannia. What shall we do with this troublesome area? A new solution must be found. Several of our ministers and supporters have voiced their own opinions regarding the region. \n \n The initial option is to grant Northern Ireland special autonomy and rights. It shall still be a member of these United Kingdoms, but shall be given its own version of local governance. This would still be emulated after much of our own systems and rule, of course, but allowed to be customised for Northern Ireland, and allow them to pass some of their own legislature. Obviously this comes at some small costs of our influence and taxation in the region, but these are relatively light. \n \n The second option is to sever all official ties with Northern Ireland, and welcome the new nation of Ulster to the stage of Europe. While this sounds nice, and is a simple way of ending the problem of the IRA attacks, the fact remains we would be backing down to these Irish terrorists. Such a shameful display on the world stage may encourage attacks and insults from our opposition, both local and foreign. \n \n The remaining option is to gift Northern Ireland to the united Irish nation. The stabilised nation is able to take in this new territory, for many of Northern Ireland also wish to become one with the rest of the ireland. Let us show our faith in the new rule, and ensure our future good relations with Ireland. \n \n We sit at the discussion table, yet the path forward remains unclear. What shall be the solution with which we fix the North Ireland problem?"
watson.14.a: "We shall accomadate for them."
watson.14.b: "It is time to release Northern Ireland."
watson.14.c: "To the friendship between the isles!"

watson.15.t: "Pressure the Emerald Isle"
watson.15.d: "It is well known that Britannia is the far more powerful island of the two British isles. Ireland is no more than a second fiddle to Britain, and should be content to play this role for the foreseeable future. The question lies, though, as to where we should push them towards. \n \n It is our place to intervene in their affairs as needed, as the greater of the two isles it is only natural. The power lies in our hands to influence their affairs as needed. \n \n We could prompt them to join the LHS, something that would likely be popular with the Irish people as a whole. \n \n We could use the threat of force to push them towards the resistance, a move that would force them to abandon potential LHS allies in Europe. \n \n Or in the end we could compel them to stay out of world affairs, ensuring that both of the isles stay firmly out of the crosshairs of any major war or alliance. \n \n All that matters in the end is the fact that they will do as we say. If they try to resist than we shall show them why they would do well to listen to us."
watson.15.a: "We must end the unrest in Ireland."
watson.15.b: "Let us bring them to the light of the LHS"
watson.15.c: "Ireland should join the resistance"
watson.15.e: "Is the Treaty of Brugg still valid?"

watson.16.t: "Never another lost battle"
watson.16.d: "After Brugg there were two factions in Ireland, vying for control and influence over the main of the island. There was, of course Fauna, and the damned IRA. We should fully decide a stance on Ireland, how we recognize and perceive the island and its people. After we do this we can determine what our next move is."
watson.16.a: "To hell with the Irish and IRA."
watson.16.b: "Fauna and her Irish are soft nature people"

watson.20.t: "The IRA"
watson.20.d: "The ceasefire following the second revolutions in England have, for the most part, calmed matters on these isles. The promise of violence and war lies in the future, without doubt, but as of the immediate present only one force commits violence on these isles. The dreaded IRA. \n \n The IRA, or Irish Republican Army, was a collective of Irish dissidents and rebels that rose against the Hololive nations. These Antis hope to topple the hololive regimes, and wish to bring back the old world order. All hololivers, Resistance or LHS-affiliated, can agree that we must eliminate these antis with extreme prejudice. \n \n These rebels and terrorists seek only to destroy our English way of life. Their plans are to harm the English people as much as possible, attempting to force us to give into their demands. We shall acquisce or back down, no matter the foes we may face. \n \n Let us deal with the IRA, as we have with all other crisises that fall our way."
watson.20.a: "Damn them!"

watson.21.t: "English concessions"
watson.21.d: "Watsons regime over England, unholy it may be, has offered us something quite interesting. They wish to give us concessions, and a sizeable amount of raw coin. The only thing we have to do in exchange is stop funding the IRA. What a joke, 'Mighty England' brought down by some petty terrorists. What shall we do?"
watson.21.a: "Basically free money."
watson.21.b: "Fuck off. Damn Englishman."

watson.22.t: "Collaboration with Watson"
watson.22.d: "Watsons diplomats have recently approached us with a proposal. They wish to send us ample amounts of funding in exchange for our cooperation. We have no real reason to refuse, in all truth. Let us work with them!"
watson.22.a: "Heres to friendship!"
 
watson.23.t: "Antis Acquiesce!"
watson.23.d: "The Antis of Ireland, hearing our request and offer, have chosen to accept. It would seem much of our toil and labor is over, we may begin to end this period of our history. \n \n It should not cost us much. It is a mere fraction of the costs that containing and fighting the IRA. To peace and stability on these isles!"
watson.23.a: "To cooperation!"

watson.24.t: "Faunas Allegiance!"
watson.24.d: "Our envoys to Faunas Ireland have been received with great kindness and acceptance. They accepted our request (and the payment with it) that they would work with us in efforts against the IRA. We can count on their assistance, our loyal aide in Ireland."
watson.24.a: "Trust between EN!"

watson.25.t: "The Irish reject our demands!"
watson.25.d: "The Irish have sent back our envoys empty-handed, declaring that no government of London shall influence the affairs of Ireland. They have turned down our offers of payments or other concessions. They insist on funding and supporting terrorists, rebels, and criminals. \n \n No longer. We must respond with extreme prejudice. These threats on England and her people shall not allowed to remain. \n \n Our forces shall rally in Northern Ireland, and we shall sweep down the island. The petty IRA or Anti forces will not stop us, mere pebbles before a landslide."
watson.25.a: "To arms!"

watson.26.t: "A Future at Belgrade"
watson.26.d: "Our future is clear, we shall stand alongside §dYagoo and the LHS§!. We've sent emissaries to §dBelgrade§!, asking for our formal entrance into the §dLHS defensive pact§!. Delighted upon our request, we were rapidly accepted into the §dshield§!, a fully fledged nation of the alliance. Should any nation, §Dresistance§! or not, attack one of this creed, then we shall all move to defend our kin! \n \n Certain elements of the government, and a minority of our people, don't support this stance; some call for ties to the §DResistance§!, while more prefer neutrality. We shall listen to the majority, however, and cement our bonds to §dBelgrade§!. London and Britannia shall serve as the first protectors of Europe, and among the first to lead the armies of the §dLHS§! towards whatever foes lie ahead. \n \n As Watson makes a speech in §dBelgrade§!, outside the headquarters of the §dLHS security council§!, the flag of this proud nation is raised high. It stands at the same height as the flags of our official §dLHS allies§!, a link in that chain that shall hold the §dLHS banner high§!. The §mopposition§! and §DResistance§! shall topple before us, so let us march forth at §dYagoos§! side, his loyal and faithful ally, an enforcer of §dBelgrade§!"
watson.26.a: "Peace, dignity, and equality for a healthy hololive."

watson.27.t: "The Bastion of the Resistance"
watson.27.d: "When Britain called for aid fighting rebels in 1931 the §dLHS§! failed to adequately support us, yet only some years later we have seen considerable support from §DResistance§! nations. While they have mainly been diplomatic support and overtures of friendship, it still proves that the underlying basis for a strong relationship exists. We shall be the next to join §DAquas resistance§!. Many see it is a shame to spurn our past relations with §dYagoo and his LHS§!, but we must sacrifice this shared history for the sake of the future. watson.27.a: "Peace, dignity, and equality for a healthy hololive. \n \n Watson has travelled to Brazil, to the capital of §DRio§!, where they shall make contact with §DAqua§!. The details of the agreement have already been worked out in private by Watson and §DAqua§!, but the official entrance ceremony will be held in §DRio§!. The two leaders shaking hands will appear on televisions throughout Brazil and England. Before the official signing of the document, Watson and Aqua will have a few prewritten and planned statements and questions, so as to reconfirm the people of England of the §DResistance's§! motives and good intentions. The people of Britain have faith in Watson, and her obvious display of approval ensures that the people will resist the propaganda of the §dLHS§!. \n \n By the end of formalities and pleasantries, the treaty has been signed, the Kingdom of Britannia now formally a member of the §DResistance§! pact. We shall be the ones to topple §dLHS§! and their global influence, saving the world from being ruled by §dBelgrade§!, all at the behest and will of a single man. As the §DResistances§! only and strongest holdout in Europe it falls on us to hold our ground. The §dLHS§! will not take our perceived betrayal lightly, and will likely come to chain and shackle us, forcing us to kneel before them. We must fortify and prepare for such events, and call upon our §DResistance§! allies to aid us."
watson.27.a: "We stand with Aqua! We stand with §DRio§!!"

watson.28.t: "The Anti Question"
watson.28.d: "Watson, though a popular figure among many, has made an equally many number of enemies and opponents. As regent she made enemies of the §Onationalists§! throughout Britannia, who rose against the regime in open rebellion. §ORebels§! throughout our home islands will never do. We must reunite our homeland and restore peace to the British Isles, bringing them all back into the fold of the §dHololive order§!. Whichever we regain first doesn't matter, but we must restore Great Britain as well as stabilise the chaotic island of Ireland. \n \n\n \nThe only question that remains is how shall we go about this? To defeat the §OScottish and English Nationalists§!, we need some major form of support, a trump card which will give us an edge over the enemy. Our main option will likely be support from the §lLHS§! or a §dHololive-affiliated§! nation, but in the event that our requests are refused by whomever we ask it would hamper our cause and appearance. On the other hand, Ireland is an entirely different beast, for Ireland was split in parts after the revolts. There are two main routes to fixing the Ireland problem, for the situation cannot stay as it is. We can either return §dNorthern Ireland to the people of the island§!, so that there is no longer need for fighting; or we must forge a new solution to fix the problems the §YTreaty of Brugg§! created. \n \n\n \nNo matter the demands of some §Orebels§!, we are the rightful ruler of Great Britain. We shall no longer bear the shame of our failure to defeat the §Onationalists§!, and we shall make the world recognize our greatness. We will rally the people of these once §PUnited Kingdoms§! to this cause, and proudly proclaim with all our might that we shall lead the §lreconquista§! of these isles!"
watson.28.a: "Let 'Rule Britannia' be more than just a phrase!"

watson.29.t: "The Easter Crisis"
watson.29.d: "Since autumn of last year, the government has been in a fierce internal debate regarding the allocation of the budget. This year marks the first instance of economic growth since the depression began, and many factions within the §dWatson government§! have been vying for control of the funding. Weeks have gone by since with little agreement having been reached. As the end of the fiscal year, April 5th, approaches, the government is obligated to have approved the next year's budget by then. Should a consensus not be reached, a vote of no confidence is almost guaranteed, which would oust the current §dWatson regime§!. Watson has withdrawn to her cabinet in a private meeting, and two plans have been outlined by the cabinet.\n\nThe first is the §dconventional§! path, one of compromise with our opposition; the socialist NLM and WA. This is sadly the nature of a §dparliamentary government§!, where differing parties must resolve their problems by aligning and working together. Should we concede on some of the points they're calling for, we would be able to pass most of the budget we want. The majority of §dWatson supporters§! would be understanding of this, however some of the far §Pextremists§! may prove unwilling to cede any political ground to the opposition. \n\nThe alternative is quite unprecedented. The §dWestminster system§! we use does not specify the exact course of action should a budget be unresolved. Citing loopholes and the need for drastic action in face of a budgetary failure, Watson could force a new budget through the parliament without a majority vote. This would outrage much of the opposition and even alienate some of the less devoted members of §dWatson's supporters§!. The more fervent and extreme followers of Watson, however, would support this move as the only way to push through a needed budget. \n\nTwo opposed and irreconcilable paths lay before the regent Watson, and whichever decision she moves forward with will decide the future of this proud nation. Watson can fully accept her role as an §dequal to the parliament§! or she may grasp greater executive authority within her hands. The latter is a road she must walk carefully, lest this power corrupt Watson. So make your decision wisely, detective, the fate of Britannia rests on your shoulders."
watson.29.a: "The rules were devised by us, we must follow them."
watson.29.b: "We devised the rules, why not bend them?"

watson.30.t: "Operation Ground Pounder"
watson.30.d: "We now set our sights northwards. We shall reconfirm the §yact of union in 1707§!, the §Nrebels§! shall deny us our homeland no longer. Newcastle and Edinburgh are among the most important cities of Britannia. The time is ripe, we shall reclaim these vital territories of Britannia. \n \n Our people call for the end of these revolts, filled with spirit and resolve. Our troops are trained and in high spirit, fully prepared for the conflicts ahead. Our leadership is decisive, and ready to organise a vast military operation to finally defeat these rebels. \n \n The operation calls for a swift attack into Northumbria, and careful movements as our forces push into Scotland. We shall hit them hard, causing the earth itself to shake and be stunned by our ferocity. It has been dubbed 'Operation: Ground Pounder'. The §Nnationalists§! shall rue the day they challenged us. "
watson.30.a: "First the rebels, second your mom!"

watson.33.t: "A New Goverment"
watson.33.d: "Watson, with Britain behind, stands at a crossroads, one that will forever change the entire island's fate. Watson is presented with two plans by her cabinet, one to preserve §ddemocracy and the parliament§!, and the other to exploit a loophole in the law and completely centralise power. Watson mulled over the options, but she distrusted the second option, for she believed in the power of §ddemocracy and in the parliament§!. \n \nAfter much debate between the two groups, she had finally decided. The people, whether of the §dworking class§! or the §Oextreme nationalists§!, would never support such a power grab. Centralising power was a one-way ticket to political disaster, and if not that, a dictatorship. \n \n\n \nShe would not repeat the mistakes of the old §Proyalty§!. \n \n\n \nShe would form a new §dcoalition government§!, similar to the §dold parliament§!, and lead all the isles towards the path of §dtrue democracy§!. With the plan now established, all that's left is to set it in motion!”"
watson.33.a: "We created the rules, and we shall adhere to them."
    
watson.34.t: "The Westminster Constitution"
watson.34.d: "Everyday the government comes closer to collapse. Those in the political centre are strained and strained, being pulled apart to the fringes; the centre cannot hold, and the §dgovernment as we know it§! may soon shatter with it. No budget has been reached in the past days, and no faction can claw themselves to victory, able to pass the budget they deem as 'necessary for the country's future'. \n \nWatson will not let this country fall, not under any circumstances. The §dcurrent Westminster system§! is outdated, it needs to be amended, modernised. Watson, in coordination with her cabinet, has drafted a revision to the §dWestminster system§!. Her faction has dubbed it the §SWestminster Constitution§!. \n \nThis amendment would give greater influence to the executive branch, giving the Regent power over the parliament. This would certainly give Watsons faction the sheer authority and power they would need. This will, however, shake the nation, and severely weaken the people's §dfaith in their government§!. Should Watson fail, or even become overambitious, it may be the spark that detonates the government, spiralling into chaos and unrest. \n \nWatson is confident, though, that she can walk that line, and with the greater powers of her position, she will be able to do what is best for Britain. With the backing of the §dteammates§!, there is nothing we cannot do!"
watson.34.a: "We will move forward, and do as we must."

watson.35.t: "Westminster - Strong"
watson.35.d: "Watson overlooks the parliament, announcing the full and final result of the Westminster constitution. The Budget. The very reason this conflict was born, and what worsened the divides in our government. Watson has the power in her hands to force through the budget of her wishes. As she dictates her command to Parliament, all they can do is either applaud and cheer or bitterly remain silent. The teammates, with Watson at the head, have clearly emerged victorious from this power struggle. \n \n All that remains to be seen is how the budget is handled. Watson may take a conservative approach, allowing the people to take the lead, encouraging private business and enterprise. However with this new found power, she now has a unique path available before her. With this centralization she can dictate the budget as she wishes. The government shall be able to assume state control over certain industries and trade. \n \n Watson is the prime power in English politics, yet it still remains how the rest of the government and country at large shall respond to this. Will the people be willing to place their faith and trust in Watson? Or will they tear at the seams, trying to bring Watson back down to her previous post?"
watson.35.a: "Unlimited power!"

watson.36.t: "Westminster - Weak"
watson.36.d: "The Westminster constitution has passed, limping through the parliament and legislative process. It is a shell of its former promised glory, but it managed to pass nonetheless. The bill was mauled by opposing elements of parliaments. This new Westminster constitution establishes that Watson is the sole figure to draft and propose a budget to parliament, but a majority vote is required by parliament in order to pass and enact said budget. \n \n Through backhand deals and large concessions, the teammates have also secured a slim, but conditional majority in parliament. The complete purity and legality of some of our actions are debatable, but the fact remains that we have obtained this advantage. We shall be able to push through our reforms, with delays and difficulties in the process ahead to be guaranteed. \n \n While a victory, it is a defeat in the eyes of the public, and something condemned or disliked by most. Supporters of Watson are disappointed, left demoralised by this shadow of the original Westminster constitution passing. Opposition to Watson, those not swayed to our side, are upset for they have not either profited from the deals we made with their previous allies, or were unable to stop us. Those neutral towards Watson find themselves disgusted and dismayed. We have sacrificed much of what little integrity our current government possesses, only for some small gains.
watson.36.a: "Im too weak..."

watson.37.t: "Westminster - Mediocre"
watson.37.d: "The Westminster constitution has passed, and while no side is completely happy, it seems that most people accept the results. The executive branch has certainly seen its own authority significantly strengthened by this, but the parliament is still a force in the power politics of England. Watson, with her new central power, has been able to exert increased pressure on the parliament to pass her legislation. Now the Teammates, with increased authority and power behind them, have the ability to push through their budget. \n \n With the force of the executive branch, and now a majority in parliament, the Teammates have the ability to dictate this year's budget as they see fit. There are two routes available to the Teammates: one of free market recovery, or one dictated by the state. The free market recovery would be more popular among the rest of parliament, but would be largely out of our own hands. However if the state is in authority of the recovery, we would have the power to mandate economic growth, choosing industries to develop. \n \n Watson has seen a considerable increase in power, yet she must still work with her allies in parliament to pass the legislation she wishes for. This should be no major challenge, and they should be able to pass their budget with no difficulties."
watson.37.a: "Such is life"

watson.40.t: "The Budget"
watson.40.d: "With cooperation from nearly all parties in Parliament, the budget has been passed and resolved. This budget revolves around the free market, letting the people and businesses take the first step towards an economic rebirth. This has been achieved through compromise and collaboration from many elements of parliament. This is for the best, democracy can only operate at its best when people are willing to work together, and we have exemplified this. \n \n This new budget shall lessen taxes, encourage business and trade, and privatize several sectors such as the railroad and energy industry. Everybody wins with these efforts, and this according to several of our lead analysts and advisors this shall spurn our economy into top gear. \n \n This is a most cheerful day in English history, and certainly something of note. Rather than civil war or bitter infighting we have chosen to put aside our differences, and come together for the sake of Britain. Of course some small sacrifices were made by all, but no blood was shed for such large efforts. This is truly a sign of a civilized and prosperous age!
watson.40.a: "Heres to unity!"
       
watson.41.t: "The Budget"
watson.41.d: "There is no longer a question of the budget. The crisis is resolved. The teammates have ensured their continued control over parliament, buying themselves ample time and power to reach their goals. With this control, they have pushed through this new budget, one granting the government vast influence over certain industries. \n \n This budget is extremely socialist in nature, down to the very wording of the budget. The teammates budget revolves around the 'four year plan' which will revitalize the nations steel and coal industry, protecting them from foreign business. \n \n Now that the matter of the budget is settled and decided, the conflict and infighting may end. Although some are bitter over their failures to win out, it matters little in the end. What is done is done. The pen signs the budget; the budget heals the people; the people birth the future!"

###Event 47 - 60 British science stuff

watson.61.t: "State of the Military"
watson.61.d: "It is a known secret that our army is quite dilapidated, for lack of a better term. While the common soldier possesses significant spirit the problem is that there is little in the way of leadership, direction, or material. Now that conflict has ended and the economic crisis has lessened, the Watson Government has seen fit to launch a formal inspection of the state of the military. After the depth of the detritus and dereliction is revealed, the Watson government will be able to formulate a plan to purge the rot and cleanse the decay. The main question on the minds of the generals and officers is what direction the armed forces will go after these bureaucratic processes are finished. \n \n What is certain, though, is that it will certainly be time to bring in both old and new personalities, the veterans and leaders of the last wars raised as generals as well the new wave of hopeful officers and reformists; for the current leadership has become stale in the eyes of many. The current general staff showed disappointing results during the 1931 revolts, a fact which remains remembered in the minds of the people and regent herself. Let us look to the future now, for the sake of London."
watson.61.a: "Let us now understand the heart of the issue."
 
watson.62.t: "Examine the Army"
watson.62.d: "Following increasingly disappointing status reports from the military, the Watson government has seen fit for mandatory reforms, a lengthy and expensive process. The problems with the watson army lies in many sectors, but the most notable one is simply that the army has hesitated to modernise. The reactionaries say that the process of modernisation could weaken the Watson army which might tempt the English and Irish to attack. Many generals plan to fight the wars of the future as we fought the great war and revolts, dug in and grinding down the enemy. The current plans will not work, and our equipment further exemplifies this bleakness, with the R&D department being severely underfunded. \n \n Despite this, many see the present situation as an opportunity. Times have changed, and so too warfare, for that we are sure of. The Watson army has made little to no movement towards a set modernised doctrine, which allows us the opportunity to plan for the future how we see fit. Among British military theorists there are two central figures and schools of thought, both branching from two of the best military thinkers of our times. Both served in the great war, as well as the first and second revolts, loyal to the Watson government. \n \n The first is Liddell Hart, a loyalist to the Watson government; he believes in the strategies of manoeuvre, that the key to warfare in the modern era will be a mechanised infantry force with combined arms. This force would drive a gap in enemy lines, which would have other mobile units flooded into the gap, to grow outwards and behind the enemies as an 'expanding torrent'. Hart has submitted to the Watson government his plans and ideas for a reformed and modern English army. \n \n The other option would be J.F.C Fuller, a capable theorist, but one with deep sympathies and ties to Aquas Resistance movements throughout London. Fuller believes in an army which revolves around a mass armoured column with which to break portions of the enemy lines, which can be surrounded and dealt with as needed. There are some concerns over elevating and working with Fuller, as he has a deserved reputation for being difficult, arrogant, and rude; not to forget his resistance nationalist allegiance. \n \n While both have similar ideas, there are key differences in the equipment and goals of the two, thus only one can be chosen and promoted to our prime military theorist in the end.
watson.62.a: "We trust Hart and his mechanised army, let us promote him."
watson.62.b: "Let us take a chance on Fuller, our armour shall roll over our foes!"

watson.63.t: "Revive the Fleet"
watson.63.d: "Prior to the years of strife, mighty Britannia was known most for one thing, ruling the waves. The English fleet was the mightiest fleet in the world, serving as Britains wall against foreign tyranny. But the hololive revolts, years of strife, economic depression, and even pirates brought this mighty naval hegemon down to a mere whisper and ghost on the seas. This is unacceptable. Thus the navy shall be reformed and rebuilt, but before we can lay a single ship's frame we must first pick the man to lead our planned fleet, and decide the direction we take the new Royal Navy. There are two promising candidates for our planner and theorist: \n \n The first choice is the admiral John Tovey, an experienced officer with a laundry list of past commands and completed courses to his name. A firm believer in large capital ships and a powerful home fleet, which can meet the opponents and dominate them in the contest over the sea.  \n \n  The second and final choice is the admiral Max Horton, a true submariner with many successful 'hunts' to his name in the great war and many successes in his past. He believes that due to the limited nature of the present Royal Navy the best stratagem will be to offensively utilise our submarine arm to its strongest potential, and force the enemy into submission.  \n Watson has the choice of two capable officers, yet in the end only one man can sit at the desk of the Royal Navy's head theorist. Who does Watson pick?"
watson.63.a: "John Tovey's capital ships are needed to rule the waves."
watson.63.b: "The fierce attacks of Max Horton will subdue and sink our foes."

watson.64.t: "Expand the RAF"
watson.64.d: "Following our examinations of elements of our military we've discovered a glaring gap and weakness in our command structure, the air force. The certain prideful navy officers would say that the air force is an extension of the navy, saying that the army has no need for planes. In contrast some elements of the army insist that the air force is part of the army foremost, for its crucial nature in land battles. The Regent will hear no more of this bickering. She has sliced through this gordian knot, and declared that the air force will be organised into a separate branch of the armed forces!  \n \n   The official 'Regent Air Force' (or RAF) will serve to extend our dominion into the skies above, an entirely new theatre to modern war. The leadership has been gathered from the most capable air officers of both the Navy and Army, forming a new command to operate out of London. The RAF will be tasked with all matters related to aerial warfare: defending the homeland, battlefield support, and taking the fight to the enemies. As the new tool of warfare, we don't know what to expect as we dive headfirst into this trial, only that we shall display the valour and courage of true 'Knights in the sky'! "
watson.64.a: "Our fight continues into the skies!"

watson.65.t: "The Ground Pounder"
watson.65.d: "The Regent air force has held a series of tests and trials to determine new the new standard bomber to be operated by the RAF. While several leading companies and designers submitted their builds and designs, there was one obvious winner above the rest. Avros' submission of their own Lancaster is clearly seen and recognized by all participants and judges as the supreme modern plane, the obvious choice to win. The Lancaster was designed, in house at the company headquarters in Stockport. \n \n The plane and its information are quickly making the rounds, the biggest piece of news about the plane ironically being its largest armaments. The bomber can be equipped with 12,000 kg bombs, powerful enough to level an entire city street or building. The demonstrations of this weapon's sheer power struck awe into the judges, theorists, and veteran pilots alike. They write of its ability to change the face of battle and city alike, and how the earth could tremble at such a force. This has given rise to its colloquial nickname among pilots as the, 'Ground Pounder'. A fitting name for such a powerful weapon. \n \n The Avro 'Ground Pounder' Lancaster, designed to specific modifications by the Avro company, will be incorporated into the RAF as their principle bomber. An intense focus and effort will be put into producing as many Ground Pounders as possible in the short term future, and training our pilots to be proficient in operating this new plane. With this mighty steel feather waiting in Englands royal wings, any enemy shall think twice before attacking us, lest this mighty bomber bring down the wrath and vengeance of our homeland upon them. The ground shall be left ravaged in our wake."
watson.65.a: "And so too your mother."

watson.67.t: "Reuniting The Crowns"
watson.67.d: "As regent for the throne, Watson protects and holds the titles of the royal family for the next ruler, safeguarding their legacy. Some titles lay with the Watson government only in de jure, however, such as the title Duke of Edinburgh. In 1931 rebels and pretenders rose throughout northern England and Scotland, and try however we might we could not defeat these rebels, despite LHS support. The thrones of England and Scotland, and thus the nations, have been in a beautiful union since 1707, and no rebels shall break that marriage. \n \n Watson gave a heartfelt speech in Trafalgar square, mourning the loss of Scotland to the good and honest people of Britannia. She stated her wish to bring the lands and crown of Scotland back to London and the English throne. Watson ended the speech with a curtain call, where she shouted out to the crowd: “Let us reunite the crowns of London and Edinburgh! Let us reunite England and Scotland! Let us retake what is rightfully ours!” "
watson.67.a: "Dieu et mon droit!"

watson.68.t: "Seek Alternative Support"
watson.68.d: "In 1931, when fighting the nationalist rebels, Watson enjoyed the full endorsement and major support from the LHS, yet still England could not win. Those very same rebels now occupy Northumbria and Scotland, believers in the old world, waiting for a chance to strike and bring back their old ways. Watson needs an ace in the whole, some counterbalance and advantage over the rebels, we believed the LHS was just that last time, but we failed. We must not make the same mistake twice, we must find another patron, so that we may stack the odds in our favour. Thankfully, there is no shortage of options. \n \n The first choice are the militarists of Europe, those nations which have the exclusive policy of 'might makes right' and that their army has to overpower that of their enemy. When these autocrats are considered as one large group they wield considerable power; especially in regards to their military might. Let us request their formal support. The main boon and curse of this is the same thing; if the militarists are to send support it will be their own troops, as trained expeditionary forces. While this is certainly a great help in the fight, it may mean making room for other troops and feeding them, as well as the fact they would be using England as a practice ground for their troops. \n \n The second choice will certainly be controversial, the resistance. The resistance of course, being the collective of states that stand against Yagoo and the LHS, originating largely with Aqua. The LHS failed us before, their support obviously lacking, so let us look to their antithesis. While it would certainly rock the boat to turn towards the resistance, despite our ties with the LHS, they would likely support us. We could count on a steady stream of political support and weaponry, for the resistance would certainly pursue closer ties with a befriendable European state, especially one that was previously LHS-affiliated. \n \n The third choice is a deal with our devil, with our sin. Drugs from the Kiryu Kai have ravaged our streets, and London's streets face a severe asacoco addiction epidemic. Few other nations suffer from the problem on such a severe scale as ours, but due to recovery from economic depression it is the hope of many that we may end this addiction. The drugs are presently carried and dealt with in secret, but if we legalised the practice, we could bargain with the Kiryu Kai. While it would, beyond shadow of doubt, severely worsen an already major problem, we could enforce that the Kiryu Kai must donate 500 pounds of armaments to the government for every 50 pounds of asacoco they import into the country. Let us pray that after this conflict we may end this addiction, and get our citizens off this accursed drug. \n \n The final choice is the stubborn choice, we have no need to make a faustian bargain with a foreign power, England shall pick itself up and defeat its foes through English means! Let us call upon the people of England; every home shall pay a tax of son and of coin. We shall levy English divisions, with English men and weapons. No foreign power shall use England as a staging ground, nor shall we be a diplomatic bargaining chip of foreign, distant alliances in their game of chess, with no regard for us. We shall forge our own destiny, and we, the English people, together, will bear the brunt of this on our backs. It shall tire and fatigue us, and cause unrest in the streets, but if that shall be the price we pay then so must it be! \n \n Let us rally our support, away from the watchful eyes of the LHS. With this force behind us, we shall throw back the nationalist rebels. The only question that remains is who to summon? We must send our pleas, but in the end it is the choice of whomever we call upon, not our choice to make."
watson.68.a: "We call upon the hounds of war, the wolves of Europe."
watson.68.b: "Yagoo failed us before, so it's Aqua's turn now."
watson.68.c: "A Faustian bargain, but a necessity."
watson.68.d: "An Englishman's home is his castle, and we must defend it."

watson.69.t: "Watson Wishes for Our Support"
watson.69.d: "England has long been an LHS nation, and Watson has also long been our friend and colleague. With this in mind they call upon our aid and network, so that they may deliver the final, decisive blow to the antis in England. These antis are a problem for all the hololive regimes, and it must be ensured that they cannot spread their terrible ideology to other nations of the LHS. \n \n With this in mind, there really is no real reason to deny them this aid. Watson, and by connection England, have long been friends of the LHS, and unless radical resistance movements were to begin to influence Watosn and London, we have no major drawbacks to aiding them. In fact, we have aided them before, when the antis first rose in revolt, although despite our aid they still failed in their efforts. \n \n Lastly, if we choose not to aid them it is entirely possible they will instead turn to the resistance, who would be more than willing to steal an important ally of ours from right under our nose. So with all these facts considered we should likely aid Watson, unless you see a reason not to?
watson.69.a: "Naturally we shall aid Watson."
watson.69.b: "We should allocate resources more wisely."

watson.70.t: "Yagoos support!"
watson.70.d: "Our good friend Yagoo of the LHS has responded to our calls for aid! We always knew we could count upon Yagoo and the shield to give us the support we needed. The vast industry of the LHS has sent us a veritable stockpile of weaponry and armor. \n \n Let us all rejoice, for when our international community comes together and stands as one we can truly make anything happen. We shall now be armed and ready to expel the antis once and for all, and bring the northlands back into our fold. \n \n So let us thank the LHS, and remember their gift for years to come. We shall also hope that perhaps some day we can pay them back in full, for while this was donated, we should always ensure we show our colors as a staunch and trustworthy ally."
watson.70.a: "Arigato Yagoo!"

watson.71.t: "Denial from Yagoo"
watson.71.d: "We have received most distressing news from Belgrade. Yagoo, and the LHS by connection, has turned down our request for aid against the Antis of the North. They sent our envoys back with only a message: “I'm sorry, my companion, but no. We all have our own destinies, and yours culminates here. I would not rob you of that.” \n \n When asked to elaborate on this Yagoo said nothing else, dismissing our diplomat and reporter. Frankly this move is completely out of left field. Yagoo would rather leave us to the wolves of Antis than spare a few of the LHS' many resources, for what reason? We have long been an ally of the LHS, and it is their fault we failed the first time the antis rebelled. They should owe us this now. \n \n Yagoo has spat in our faces, let us return the gesture in kind. Perhaps the resistance, flying Aquas proud Hololive banner high, would be open to talks regarding a new member? They would certainly treat us better than Yagoo has. This was truly a pathetic move on the part of Yagoo.
watson.71.a: "What the fuck is wrong with you, Yagoo?"

watson.72.t: "Watson Requests Our Support"
watson.72.d: "Watson has sent an ambassador carrying a message, and to put their request simply they wish for help. In their planned struggle and war against the remaining Antis throughout Great Britain, they have a need for armaments and equipment. It wouldn't cost us much at all to aid them significantly, but the question boils down mainly to if we should aid them. \n \n Watson, and England by connection, has long been associated with the LHS. In fact, last time they attempted to fight the antis they enjoyed extensive LHS support. There is no gurantee if we give them these weapons that the very steel we gift them with may be turned on us. \n \n There is an opportunity in this, though. Should we aid England, and Watson by connection, they will remember this. Our being sympathetic and aiding their cause would indebt them to us, and allow us to take the high ground. We came to their call to aid, and unlike the LHS we will secure their victory with these armaments and weaponry. We will show our strength to the world, that we can go and fight successfully where the LHS could not. In addition, the English are quite prospective future members of the Resistance, as they hang right off the side of Europe, able to threaten much of the LHS without venturing afar. It would also deprive Yagoo of an important ally. What shall it be, leader of the Resistance and free world?
watson.72.a: "We would never turn down Watson."
watson.72.b: "Let the LHS solve their own issues."

watson.73.t: "Resistance support!"
watson.73.d: "Aqua and Shion have responded to our requests for aid, sending us vast arsenals of armaments and equipment. With this newly received steel from the Resistance, we shall be able to strike down the Antis of the northlands. Watson was able to secure this support after brief talks with Aqua and Shion. The two were more than willing to provide us with the weapons we need, so long as we remember this favor in the future, and realize that the LHS failed to support us in our time of need. \n \n We certainly owe them much for this support, let us seek to pay this debt back in the future. Many in English politics have started calling for our breaking away from the LHS, for despite all we do as a member they have failed to respond to our calls for aid. A small amount of these politicians call out for us to seek closer ties to the Resistance, our true comrades and cultural hololive brothers. \n \n With all politics aside, we now possess the raw strength and arms we need to topple the Antis. We shall march into Northumbria and Scotland, and restore these lands to our English fold.
watson.73.a: "Three hurrahs for friendship!"

watson.74.t: "Denial from the Resistance"
watson.74.d: "Aqua and Shion have denied us our request for aid. They are true traitors to everything we Hololive nations stand for. Regardless of Resistance and LHS lines we should share a common enemy of the Antis, who seek only to drag us back into the darkness of the old world order. This will not stand! \n \n Furthermore, the gall of these two to deny us this request! We humble ourselves before them, as a member of the LHS, to reach across this divide and call for aid. Furthermore the pride! To turn away a potential ally and friend, when the world grows over so closer to turmoil and chaos. We shall not forget this slight, and this insult. \n \n The Resistance denies us, and should the LHS deny us aid we are truly lost and forsaken, an island in the loneliest meaning of the world. Britain shall stand for herself, by herself, protecting her great ideals from the Anti menace and traitors to the Hololive ideal. We are alone, yet we shall stand strong."
watson.74.a: "Forward!"

watson.75.t: "A request from Watson"
watson.75.d: "Watson has approached us with a request, although it was not one we expected, to say the least. They have asked that we equip and supply their forces during their campaign against the antis. It shows their weakness, that they cannot go to one of the two great Hololive Blocs, and instead come to us. We could certainly spare the arms, both infantry and armor, which would take us a long way in world politics. The English would owe us a great debt, this is in addition to London and many other English cities already being mass consumers of Asacoco. \n \n This could be an opportunity to increase our foothold over England, and remind them just how important our goods are to the English people. Furthermore, our own position on the world stage is precarious, we find ourselves with many who detest us and our primary export. Both the LHS and Aquas Resistance seek to cut our influence down to size, but we cannot allow this to happen. It may be prudent to make an ally of Watson, and this would be a wise first step. \n \n Granted it may simply be better to leave Watson out to dry. Her nation is only just recovering from years of disarray and disaster, she may simply be more trouble than it is worth. What say you, boss Coco?"
watson.75.a: "We will help her"
watson.75.b: "Why bother?"

watson.76.t: "Coco comes to our aid!"
watson.76.d: "Boss Coco has accepted our request for aid and armaments! The first shipment will be arriving soon, a shipload of armor and arms for our English boys. We certainly do owe them a great debt for this. Now of course they will likely use this debt to increase their influence on London, especially the amount of cursed asacoco which shall arrive on our shores, but there is little we can do. Without the support of the LHS or Resistance we are forced to rely on a third party like this, although this is an interesting prospect. \n \n Perhaps there is something to be said for this Coco, and maybe even in a positive manner. We should always consider turning and aligning ourselves with her, for Cocos considerable strength is something never to overlook. Even more, if we stand with no faction we may simply be killed off alone, or forced to play a proxy war on their behalf. That will not do, so let us keep an open mind towards Coco."
watson.76.a: "Three hurrahs!"

watson.77.t: "Coco says no"
watson.77.d: "We have received grim news and response from Coco, yet one that we understand. At this time they cannot provide us with support or arms.  This is what we expected to happen, yet it still pains and stings to hear this. Fear naught, though, we shall still succeed even if the entire world turns its back on us, for we are the teammates!"
watson.77.a: "To Watson!"

watson.79.t: "Watson asks for funding."
watson.79.d: "Amelia Watson is hoping to secure funding from us in order to help sustain control over her territories."
watson.79.a: "Absolutely"
watson.79.b: "Meh, let her sink"

watson.80.t: "Despot declines funding for us."
watson.80.d: "In a shocking decision, the nation we requested for aid has declined sending important material aid for us. When learning this news, her highness Amelia Watson was furious."
watson.80.a: "I am going to destroy you one day!"

watson.81.t: "We must tax our citizens."
watson.81.d: "Running a country isn't cheap, especially one that faces the prospect of war everyday. Although controversial, Amelia Watson and the cabinet has deemed it necessary that we tax our citizens in order to fund our country, and to better build up our industry and army, should the British rebellion in the north march southward."
watson.81.a: "We will do what we must."

watson.82.t: "The Sun Dawns, and shall never set"
watson.82.d: "This day in history shall be remembered for decades to come, for the idea of the mighty British empire has returned!  Many outsider lookers have began to ponder what this could mean for the greater world. Manynations have began to prepare some sort or defense against any possible incursion by this event, this has mainly been seen by towns preparing trenches and creating makeshift weapons. A few nations have began to report Foreign British citizens coming out in the streets to cheer the return of the empire."
watson.82.a: "Pax Britannia!"

watson.83.t: "Examining our Position"
watson.83.d: "The curtain has closed on the struggle for the British Isles, Newcastle and Edinburgh have been reclaimed by our proud army. Ireland stands pacified and calm, with reconstruction and peace well underway. This is a resounding success and peace, yet now a strange tension has washed  over London, and a stillness has settled in the streets. The people of England can't help but ask themselves and each other, “What now?”, for now they've defeated their enemies. Their homeland is united, many don't feel a need for aggression, instead many wish to enjoy the fruits of these labours. Yet the motivated and the radicals draw in close, with their own goals and agendas. \n \n Many wish to see England return to its former status and honour of merely some few decades ago, as the international police and guard of order. They see now that we would no longer be alone in this endeavour, and that the LHS, with all it stands for, would safeguard peace and unity. We have long been loyal and faithful to the alliance, why not now formally join the defensive pact of the LHS? We shall stand as a naval safeguard and protector of the LHS order, venturing forth to protect the ideals shared by Yagoo, Watson, and the people of England. \n \n There are those, however, who note and remember the failures of the LHS. The LHS failed to stop Asacocos influence and corruption from spreading rampantly, as well as their many failed and pointless global interventions. They believe no alliance with so much vast power should fail so spectacularly, leading many to agree with Aquas resistance movement. They wish for England to serve as the island of the resistance, clinging to the side of England, a bastion in the Atlantic to stop Yagoo from spreading across his ideology Europe. \n \n Yet still, as said before, a sizable amount just wish to rest. They see no reason to fight another nation's war. Should we promise neutrality in this conflict between the alliances we would bring a sense of calm and peace to England, as promised. This is not to say we would merely sit idle, though, we still remember the days when we ruled a quarter of the globe. Watson herself fought in South Africa for England, so why let these lands we once claimed simply fall away? Should we focus on regaining lost strength as these two factions tore each other down, we could find ourselves emerging from this decade as a major world power, of its own bloc. \n \n 	So Watson, the map and compass are given to you, by a proud and faithful people, who see all that we have built and all that we have grown. They have trust in your guidance, do not disappoint them. In what direction does Britannia sail?"
watson.83.a: "We trust Yagoo, fly the sigil of the LHS."
watson.83.b: "The LHS have failed the hololive order, now we turn to Aqua."
watson.83.c: "Pax Britannia awaits, let us now seize it ourselves!"

watson.84.t: "Help those who fight the Antis"
watson.84.d: "As we consolidate our position, it is time we consider sending aid to other nations locked in conflict against antis to secure their countries abroad."
watson.84.a: "Help them."

 watson_security.1.t: "Rebels seize London!"
 watson_security.1.d: "It was nearly quarter to 8 in the morning. Men of all ages gathered around nervously and waited for the signal as ordinary people went about their daily lives in the crowded city. Lee Enfields and Tommy Guns accompanied Webleys, shyly hid inside coats. After an eternity, the minute arm finally struck 12. Adreneline set in as the march finally begun.\n\nInsurgent banners flew high. The streets became battlegrounds. Post offices, radio stations and town squares were barricaded as the first clashes with the police began. The rebels had their eyes on the true prize though, Westminster. Ministers had fled the city faster than the news had spread, leaving the guards from the Wellington Barracks to put up a last ditch effort to repel the rebels. However as more and more piled in from even outside of London, soldiers and civil servants fled their post as the revolution's ringleaders organized a temporary government in Westminster. At the end of the day, the revolutionaries once again wait nervously as they wait for the Watson government's counter-offensive."

watson_insurgency.1.t: "IRA Bombs infrastructure!"
watson_insurgency.1.d: "The IRA have bombed several roads in England! A small few were killed in traffic-bombings, with several more wounded by the bombs and flames. It is imperative we repair the damage, but that is not all we must do. If we cannot stop the source of this, stop the IRA, they will only continue to bomb our cities!"
watson_insurgency.1.a: "Damn them!"

watson_insurgency.2.t: "IRA kills local garrison!"
watson_insurgency.2.d: "A small garrison in Northern Ireland have been slaughtered en masse in the middle of the night. IRA agents staged diversionary attacks in nearby neighborhoods, in order to draw out the watch and main force from the guards barracks. Several revolutionaries then smuggled bombs into the base, triggering them while many of the garrison were resting in barracks or going about nightly duties. Many soldiers were unfortunately lost in the attacks, and many more wounded. The IRA must pay. We shall bring the righteous fury of the English people down upon them, and we must strike with all our vengeance!"
watson_insurgency.2.a: "Damn them!"

watson_insurgency.3.t: "IRA plot Discovered"
watson_insurgency.3.d: "Our intelligence agency has pulled another victory for the English in our struggle with the IRA! Several agents, embedded within the IRA, blew the whistle on planned IRA operations. The rebels planned on bombing London herself, and raiding several arms factories within London. \n \n We allowed the IRA to draw close to their objective, and once they were near the bait we sprung the trap. The IRA forces were captured to a man, with a small few who resisted arrest being gunned down. No London constables were killed in the attack, with two valiant officers being wounded by enemy fire. \n \n The people of London cheer, and so do we!"
watson_insurgency.3.a: "Heres to our victory!"
