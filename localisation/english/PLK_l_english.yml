PLK_omaru_polka: "Omaru Polka"
PLK_omaru_polka_desc: "Omaru Polka is the current Prime Minister of LHS Canada as mandated by the LHS. Although the Polka's Canada operates almost identically to pre-war Canada and in accordance to LHS guidelines, this system is rather unsatisfactory for Polka. The years of tiresome bureaucracy in the LHS and pro-Yagooist speeches have made her tired of the system and she wishes to change Canada.\n\nPolka arrived in Canada on the fringes of society, living in poverty for several years. She organized a strong socialist and anarchist following in her time before the Hololive Revolution and became a figurehead for Quebecois nationalism. When the Hololive Revolution broke out, she organized the Quebecois independence fighters into a competent fighting force and defeated the British loyalists. Polka's post-war government was a decentralized socialist government that was heavily pro-Quebecois, called the National Circus, but was forced by the LHS to make concessions to conservative Anglo-Canadians to create a federal style republic.\n\nPolka's dream of a free Canada remains suppressed by the LHS's mandate government system, all in the name of keeping pre-war elements of Canadian society quiet. Polka's Quebecois supporters are beginning to question her loyalties and devotion to the National Circus. With the LHS showing its cracks and globalist system beginning to lose, perhaps it is time for Polka to restore her anarchist dream."
