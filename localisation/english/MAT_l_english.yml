MAT_matsuri_natsuiro_desc: "	Natsuiro Matsuri is a grand religious figure in control of most of India. In her new religion, she has declared herself “god”, governing over the subcontinent with an enlightened but authoritarian rule. Considered one of the most “yabai” of the Hololivers by LHS standards, she is close with the Resistance.\n\nMatsuri was ordered to destabilize British India on the orders of Yagoo during the Hololive Revolution. She gathered a great number of followers by creating a new age religious movement with her at the center and leveraged anti-British, pro-Indian independence movements to take control of India. She disagreed with numerous LHS policies and it put her at odds with Yagoo, finding common grounds with Pekora's ideology and Coco's Resistance. In the early 1930s, Matsuri invaded Okayu due to secure oil and prove her anti-LHS position. The invasion went poorly however as Matsuri lost the war, causing her to cede parts of Southern India, Sri Lanka, Pondecherry, and Goa to the LHS.\n\nMatsuri holds a great deal of revanchism towards Yagoo and the LHS, seeking to take vengeance for her loss in the War of the Sands and to reclaim her rightful lands in India. She must leverage her closeness to the Resistance, particularly the Coco side of things along with the local Usada Kensetsu presence to achieve her aims and restore honour."
