BTN_shishiro_botan_desc: "Shishiro Botan is the warlord of Western Canada and Alaska. Renowned as a world class soldier and general, she essentially leads an army with a state. Her abilities as a military leader and natural charisma have drawn many soldiers of various nationalities to her, namely former Russian soldiers. She is a down to earth, no nonsense Hololiver who is arguably the best soldier and officer that Hololive has to offer.\n\nBotan's arrival to the past was practically hatched from a cannonball; she was an outdoorswoman who enlisted in the British Army at the outbreak of the Great War and showed her prowess in battle. Her skills as a warrior and natural leadership gave her the nickname “La Lion” that created a cult of personality around her on the battlefield on both sides of the war. Her drifting through the battlefields of the Great War and Hololive Revolution lead her to Russia where she lead a formidable army of White Russians against the Bolsheviks, but was eventually pushed around to Vladivostok where she made an escape to Canada with her private army who then aided in the North American theater of the Hololive Revolution, defeating British Canadian loyalists.\n\nBotan currently maintains control of the West Coast of Canada and Alaska where she governs over a military force that just so happens to control a state. Botan and her men are still bitter over their retreat from  Russia years ago and thus she has made the promise to someday return to Russia and reclaim her lost glory. It would be a grand and dangerous expedition however that would risk much of her current standing. She must make the choice to return to Russia to take revenge or settle down her forces in North America."
