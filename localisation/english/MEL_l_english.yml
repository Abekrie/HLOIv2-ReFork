MEL_yozora_mel: "Yozora Mel"
MEL_yozora_mel_desc: "Yazora Mel is the brutal, pro-Pekora dictator of Romania. She rules over the country with her own party, the Yazora Guard, who maintain the rule of law with authoritarian policy. She is also known as the Banpire in the LHS due to her anti-Yagooist policies, causing her to be alienated by the entirety of the LHS and a trade embargo issued upon her country.\n\nMel was originally close to Yagoo's inner circle in the early days of the Hololive Revolution, but strayed from the original Yagooist thought through Pekora, who she wholeheartedly believed in, especially in the doctrine of Idol nationalism. The rumours of Mel being a vampire were spread by an unknown source, likely by LHS slander but she leveraged the rumour and used it as a means to squash dissent in her nation.	Mel must defend her border from Yagoo directly and contend with the LHS trade embargo placed on her nation. It is only covertly through the Black Sea that Mel is able to reach the likeminded Pekora and bordering her North is a friendly, pro-Resistance Rushia. As the LHS's grip is weakening around the world, the unstable Aloe state seems to be a prime spot for expansion as the Banpire needs to spread her wings."
