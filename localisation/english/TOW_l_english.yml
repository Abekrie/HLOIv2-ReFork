TOW_towa_tokoyami: "Tokoyami Towa"
TOW_towa_tokoyami_desc: "Tokoyami Towa is the governor of Xinjiang, reigning over the homeland of the Uyghur people. Despite her claims to be a “ruthless warlord” of the region to scare off dangerous neighbours, her rule over the troubled region is quiet and stable. Her caring nature maintains the delicate balance of Han Chinese and Uyghur religions that originally plagued the area.\n\nTowa became the governor of Xinjiang by complete accident; after the end of the Great War and the signing of the Treaty of Brugg, Towa was one of the few Hololivers to refuse governance of a state in the Hololive world order. Instead, she chose to travel the world. Her travels would come to an end when she reached Kashgar where she helped resolve ethnic conflict between the Han Chinese and Uyghurs. Under the wishes of the people, Towa reluctantly became the governor of Xinjiang and began utilizing LHS aid money to develop the region. The aid slowed due to the Great Depression however, and the original problems of Xinjiang were beginning to resurface.\n\nEconomic hardships due to the Great Depression have reignited class and ethnic divides in Towa's Xinjiang. The lack of industrialization and old guard of the government prevents much social mobility and the Ma Clique to the West remains a present threat. Asacoco also flows in from Watame's Tibet that causes social disruption. Towa needs to keep the people of Xinjiang together through the hard times and build up her nation, and perhaps go beyond the Northwest frontier."
