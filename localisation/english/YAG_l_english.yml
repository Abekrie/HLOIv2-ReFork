YAG_yagoo: "Motoaki Tanigo"
YAG_yagoo_desc: "Motoaki Tanigo, now known only as Yagoo, proudly bears many titles. Chief Executive of Hololive, Grand President of Yagooslavia, Father of the Revolution, and High-Patron of all idols; he was the one who formed the great corps of Hololivers and led the charge against the mistakes of the past. Yagoo swore to prevent the horrors of history and so he brought his faithful idols to the past with him. Yagoo forged the ideals of Hololivism, spearheading the charge against the regimes of the old world.\n\nYagoo, upon being brought to the past, found himself in the proud city of Belgrade, in the year 1905. He played minor political roles under the banner of the People's Liberation Party, but failed to be elected to any positions of real power. Once the great war was unleashed on Serbia, he was dishonorably expelled from the party. He continued his campaigning unsuccessfully, until Sora's 1915 revolt in Athens, the first uprising of the Hololive cause. The Serbian government placed Yagoo under house arrest and by the Central powers in late 1915. After the Central and Allied powers agreed to a ceasefire, Yagoo led an uprising in Belgrade, signaling the true start of the Hololive Revolution. In 1920, the Hololive World Order was cemented in the Treaty Of Brugg where Hololivers carved up the globe to administer with Yagoo and his Hololive Seiso principles at the helm.\n\nThe times have no been kind to Yagoo and his world order; economic depression, civil strife and factionalism among Hololivers have torn his dream asunder and it is up to him now to clean up the mess around the world. The Resistance is currently a thorn on Yagoo's side that directly opposes the LHS, but even on his borders, the Hololivers fight amongst themselves and spread false ideologies of “idol freedom”. Yagoo must restore global order or all the work of the Hololive Revolution will be in vain."
