GAW_gawr_gura: "Gawr Gura"
GAW_gawr_gura_desc: "Gawr Gura is the reigning governor and ruler of Central China.She is currently the legitimate and approved central government of Hololive China as mandated by both the LHS and arguably popular opinion. Her silver tongued charisma and cute nature has captured the loyalty of former warlords and Chinese peasants alike. She has grand plans for China in the coming future and is one of the gold standard idols of the LHS.\n\nGura's rise to power was both a recipe of her own personal skill and taking advantage of an opportunity. She was dispatched by Yagoo to intervene and deal with the deteriorating China situation in the mid-1920s where the Hololive China branch collapsed into civil war and were being invaded by the Japanese. Gura created a united Hololive force in China that defeated the Japanese and pushed them out of mainland East Asia. Her victory over the Japanese invaders and appearance as a central authority figure over a fractured China gave her legitimacy in the region, and back with LHS funding she rebuilt China and pushed the nation on the road to industrialization.\n\nGura's China is currently one of the fastest growing and industrializing nations in the LHS and arguably the world. The exponential growth of the nation makes her the star of the LHS and Gura maintains the balance of power in the region. She is not without enemies however; her takeover of Hololive China has caught the ire of the former Hololive China branch members who all sit around her borders, waiting for an opportunity to strike and reclaim their lost glory. Gura's China is on a steady and rapid path to growth and she plans to continue down this road, but must keep an eye out for the enemies around her who want nothing but to see her demise."
