IRO_iroha_kazama: "Kazama Iroha"
IRO_iroha_kazama_desc: "Kazama Iroha is the leader of the Kodoha Faction of the Imperial Japanese Army. In her time before joining the Kenpeitai, she studied traditional samurai swordsmanship and the way of bushido, living a life of zen. When called up by her superior Laplus and ultimate Yagoo under her LHS cover, Iroha pretended to be a man and joined the Kenpeitai to get deep into Japanese politics and military organization. Her diligence and resolute ability to follow orders let her rise through the ranks where she eventually became the leader of the Kodoha Faction.\n\nThrough biding her time and building power in the chaos of the Sino-Japanese War, Iroha was able to strengthen the Kodoha Faction and launched an insurrection that overthrew the current Japanese government. Iroha's pro-emperor restorationist stance gave her plenty of popularity throughout Japan and resonated with many militarists.\n\nCurrently Iroha must rebuild Japan from its bloody insurrection and start leveraging Japanese nationalism to further the interests of Hololive and ultimately her master Laplus. She must rebuild Japan and reorient its aggression towards the goal of HoloX's world domination."
