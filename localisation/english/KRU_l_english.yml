KRU_kobo_kanaeru_desc: "Kanaeru Kobo is the leader of the populist, agrarian Kobo Kult that has taken Indonesia by storm. Aside from being a spiritual leader, Kobo is an Indonesian nationalist through and through as she wants to create a self-sufficient Indonesia free of foreign influences.\n\nKobo's cult began in the early 1900s thanks to her great charisma and appeal to Indonesian nationalism from the Dutch. Kobo was one of the first HoloID's to fight a guerrilla war against Dutch rule before the Great War and helped steamroll the colonial government at the outbreak of the Hololive Revolution. She and her followers joined the 2nd Hololive Indonesia Republic on its creation but quickly left due to a lack of adoption of her cult's religion as it was a secular state and Moona's administration allowed for too much foreign influence into Indonesia politics. She retreated her followers to New Guinea and set up a base of operations there despite the poor infrastructure. Over the years, she has also fought off numerous incursions by the bordering Haatons and continues to fight them off, preventing Indonesia from being overrun by Haachama.\n\nKobo wishes to put her hat in the ring as Indonesia collapses into civil war; she wishes to free her homeland from the likes of the LHS, Resistance, and Usada Kensetsu to create an Indonesia for Indonesians Aside from opposing HoloIDs, her greatest threat is Haachama at her border who is poised to invade at any time."
