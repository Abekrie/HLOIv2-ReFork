NEN_nene_momosuzu: "Momosuzu Nene"
NEN_nene_momosuzu_desc: "Momosuzu Nene is the dictator of the Amur region of Siberia, currently serving as a puppet under the Tentacult. Although the political stability of Nene's state hangs by a thread, she maintains an upbeat attitude and has great hope for the future wherever she goes. The lack of national identity of Nene's state is made up for her personal diplomacy with local leaders and plenty of Tentacult backing.\n\nThe formation of Nene's state was a byproduct of the Russian Revolution and ultimately the Treaty of Brugg. Nene organized a haphazard defense against the Red and White Russian armies post-Brugg and was saved at the last minute by Ina's Tentacult. As such, Nene remains indebted to Ina and continues to serve as a buffer state for the Tentacult on the Siberian frontier. During the chaos of the Japanese invasion of China in the 1930s, Nene also took in a number of Chinese refugees and interned a number of Japanese settlers fleeing Manchuria and Korea.\n\nThe ethnic clashes of Nene's state remains to be the most pressing matter as a lack of national identity is a large source of instability for her fledgling nation. Nene must find a way to unite the divided peoples of her state and shake off Ina's tentacles if she wishes to survive."

nene.1.t: "Gura Demands Our Submissions"
nene.1.d: "It’s bad news o’ great wife! An ultimatum from Gura has arrived demanding our immediate submission! We might be able to curry favour with the Grand Priestess herself in the Tentacult but whether we can truly rely on her aid is the question. Submission may not seem like a good option here but it could mean we sever ties and reliance on the Tentacult. Are we trading the devil we know for one we do not though? Whatever you choose, we will follow you!"
nene.1.a: "Super Nenechi refuses!"
nene.1.b: "Eh? That's not too bad"
