MUM_nanashi_mumei: "Nanashi Mumei"
MUM_nanashi_mumei_desc: "Nanashi Mumei was the former governor of LHS Egypt until her supposed timely demise at the hands of Pekora's army. Known for her bloodthirsty nature in combat and use of scorched earth tactics, Mumei was feared by enemies of the LHS. Mumei believes in victory by any means and holds the LHS's Yagooist doctrine to a high degree; she is willing to use any and all means to defeat the enemies of Yagoo, even the most questionable ones.\n\nMumei governed Egypt post-Brugg and built up the nation based on Hololive idealism as laid out by Yagooist doctrine. She ruled modestly and put down several traditionalist rebellions in the region. By the 1930s, Pekora began creating border skirmishes and incursions into Mumei's territory which eventually lead to the Peko-Yagoo War of 1930. Mumei's forces bore the brunt of the fighting, with Mumei leading from the frontlines herself. In the midst of the fighting however, Mumei went missing and a ceasefire was signed by Pekora and the LHS. Mumei was declared KIA.\n\nEgypt is currently run by an LHS council meant to find Mumei. However efforts have been bone dry in recent years up until 1935 and early 1936, where an insurgent force known as the Nile Liberation Army have begun popping up along Pekora's territory in Egypt. Rumours of a so called “djinn” leading the Nile Liberation Army have begun to arise amongst Pekoran troops and every night patrols had their throats slit and pro-Pekora villages burnt to the ground. In the aftermath of these gruesome attacks, patrols often found feathers of an owl. This djinn is assumed to possibly be Nanashi Mumei, whose death was never confirmed."
