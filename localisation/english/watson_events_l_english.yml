watson.1.t:0 "King George V has died!"
watson.1.d:0 "While a divisive figure in the eyes of many, the previous King of the British Empire, George V, has peacefully passed away in his sleep. After his abdication of the throne, for which Watson is now the regent, the older man settled into his title as the Duke of Windsor. There was little any opposition to the old monarchy could do, for he was largely protected by aristocratic elements of the National Teammate Front. \n \n So George V withdrew from public life, resigning himself to a comfortable and peaceful retirement in his estates, primarily the Windsor castle. This self-imposed political and public exile was a thing rarely broken, save for appearances at the Wimbledon Tennis Championship and a few other occasions. The Duke's chief physician, Lord Dawson of Penn, said only that, “The Duke's life is moving peacefully towards its close.” and remarked further that the Duke had passed.” When word was brought to Watson all the regent had to say was:"

watson.2.t:0 "Antarctic Expedition Returns!"
watson.2.d:0 "Brave and daring Teammate explorers have returned from their Graham Land Expedition! The survey team privately volunteered to explore the distant, icy wasteland; setting off in the year 1934. They received small scientific grants from the Watson administration, specifically from the London Geographical Society and the Colonial Office. A lesser amount of money came from private sponsors and drives. The expedition used these scant funds to purchase an old three masted ship, the majority of the being remarkable volunteers all opting out of pay in order to pursue this admirable goal. \n \n  The expedition was a remarkable success, thanks in large part to the use of experienced sled dogs and aerial survey by biplane. The biplane (model de Havilland Fox Moth), piloted primarily by second-in-command and chief pilot W.E Hampton, proved to be a key figure in the expedition, their aerial reconnaissance being important in determining that the Graham Land is a peninsula, not an island. Hampton has been hired into the Teammate air force as an advisor, his experience in difficult weather conditions and aerial scouting solidifying his role."

watson.3.t:0 "Disaster at Holditch Colliery"
watson.3.d:0 "As the black smoke rose over Staffordshire, wives wept and children mourned, for a terrible disaster had befallen the workers of Holditch Coal Mine. It initially began with a fire in the lower reaches of the mines that was quickly detected by miners Herman Payne and William Beardmore. The two miners alerted the crew of the dangers below. This fire spread rapidly, and threatened the lives of the 55 miners who were inside. The bold and daring crew gathered their gear and rallied to fend off the fires that were crawling up from the depths. \n \n  However valiantly the crew fought, the fire seemed to be undefeatable. Mr. John Davies, a manager of the mine, drafted a plan, one which would have been successful in containing the fire and the firedamp (flammable gas) explosions. His plan called for the erecting of two stopping dams in stable ground that was closer to the entrance, which stifled the fires air flow and made it so material could be brought quicker. However upon the arrival of Mr. John Cocks, managing director of the mine, the plan was changed. This new plan called for erecting three dams in unstable ground. This was further from the entrance which resulted in material being brought in slower while also allowing air and fuel to flow to the fire. This was done in order to protect the coal reserves underground from being consumed in the fire, which would have hampered profits. Due to this gross failure by management, 30 people have perished and 8 were severely wounded. Now the people of England look to see what Watson will do."

watson.3.c:0 "The workers should have been more careful."
