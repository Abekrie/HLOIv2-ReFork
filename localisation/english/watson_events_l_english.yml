watson.1.t:0 "King George V has died!"
watson.1.d:0 "While a divisive figure in the eyes of many, the previous King of the British Empire, George V, has peacefully passed away in his sleep. After his abdication of the throne, for which Watson is now the regent, the older man settled into his title as the Duke of Windsor. There was little any opposition to the old monarchy could do, for he was largely protected by aristocratic elements of the National Teammate Front. \n \n So George V withdrew from public life, resigning himself to a comfortable and peaceful retirement in his estates, primarily the Windsor castle. This self-imposed political and public exile was a thing rarely broken, save for appearances at the Wimbledon Tennis Championship and a few other occasions. The Duke's chief physician, Lord Dawson of Penn, said only that, “The Duke's life is moving peacefully towards its close.” and remarked further that the Duke had passed.” When word was brought to Watson all the regent had to say was:"
watson.1.a:0 "“A good man, a great tragedy.”"
watson.1.b:0 "“Good Riddance!”"
watson.1.c:0 "“Who?”"

watson.2.t:0 "Antarctic Expedition Returns!"
watson.2.d:0 "Brave and daring Teammate explorers have returned from their Graham Land Expedition! The survey team privately volunteered to explore the distant, icy wasteland; setting off in the year 1934. They received small scientific grants from the Watson administration, specifically from the London Geographical Society and the Colonial Office. A lesser amount of money came from private sponsors and drives. The expedition used these scant funds to purchase an old three masted ship, the majority of the being remarkable volunteers all opting out of pay in order to pursue this admirable goal. \n \n  The expedition was a remarkable success, thanks in large part to the use of experienced sled dogs and aerial survey by biplane. The biplane (model de Havilland Fox Moth), piloted primarily by second-in-command and chief pilot W.E Hampton, proved to be a key figure in the expedition, their aerial reconnaissance being important in determining that the Graham Land is a peninsula, not an island. Hampton has been hired into the Teammate air force as an advisor, his experience in difficult weather conditions and aerial scouting solidifying his role."

watson.3.t:0 "Disaster at Holditch Colliery"
watson.3.d:0 "As the black smoke rose over Staffordshire, wives wept and children mourned, for a terrible disaster had befallen the workers of Holditch Coal Mine. It initially began with a fire in the lower reaches of the mines that was quickly detected by miners Herman Payne and William Beardmore. The two miners alerted the crew of the dangers below. This fire spread rapidly, and threatened the lives of the 55 miners who were inside. The bold and daring crew gathered their gear and rallied to fend off the fires that were crawling up from the depths. \n \n  However valiantly the crew fought, the fire seemed to be undefeatable. Mr. John Davies, a manager of the mine, drafted a plan, one which would have been successful in containing the fire and the firedamp (flammable gas) explosions. His plan called for the erecting of two stopping dams in stable ground that was closer to the entrance, which stifled the fires air flow and made it so material could be brought quicker. However upon the arrival of Mr. John Cocks, managing director of the mine, the plan was changed. This new plan called for erecting three dams in unstable ground. This was further from the entrance which resulted in material being brought in slower while also allowing air and fuel to flow to the fire. This was done in order to protect the coal reserves underground from being consumed in the fire, which would have hampered profits. Due to this gross failure by management, 30 people have perished and 8 were severely wounded. Now the people of England look to see what Watson will do."
watson.3.a:0 "Let us aid in the cleanup efforts."
watson.3.b:0 "We must reprimand Management!"
watson.3.c:0 "The workers should have been more careful."

watson.10.t:0 “The BBC Expands Into Television”
watson.10.d:0 "After the Great War, the British Broadcasting Corporation was created by Amelia Watson to bring order and stability over the messy post-war landscape. However, the newly-christened ‘BBC’ had been restricted to activities in radio. New years bring new technologies, however, and with television now overtaking radio in popularity, it would only be fitting for the BBC to enter the television market.\n Of course, what remains now is what to do with this new television station. After all, being state-owned has its perks and would continue stabilising the regime (and maybe protecting it from some… subversives as well). Then again, letting the station report the news in a neutral point of view would also play into Amelia’s favour, as she would be portrayed as someone who would take all political opinions into account. A third option is to make it an entertainment channel primarily. If one wanted to look at the news instead, they could always switch back to radio, and plus, this new venture would surely help to honour a particular patron of Watson…"
watson.10.a:0 "State-owned means state-run, glory to Watson!"
watson.10.b:0 "Let’s give the old “freedom of speech” a try…"
watson.10.c:0 "Baker Street better than Cable Street, innit?"

watson.11.t:0 “Foundation of the Women’s Voluntary Service”
watson.11.d:0 "While Amelia Watsons exact origins are unclear, her first public appearance was as a combat medic and nurse in the Boer Wars. For her efforts in saving many British soldiers, she was awarded the Order of Merit. \n \n Thanks to her service in the war, it is perhaps no surprise that it was Watson who proposed the idea of the Women’s Voluntary Service. This would be an extended branch of the existing Civil Defense Service whose duty is to prepare the British population from any threats and assist them if need be, just like Watson herself did during her wartime service. Given the deteriorating geopolitical situation, everyone would need to play their part to prepare for a future conflict, including the women as well. Many observers and factions applaud the founding of the WVS, and hope that it leads to further development of the non-traditional roles women will play in modern society."
watson.11.a:0 "Everyone can do their part for their country now!"

watson.12.t:0 “Freud Arrives in London”
watson.12.d:0 "The famous psychiatrist Sigmund Freud moved to London, seeking to escape from the political chaos that had engulfed his homeland. With political turmoil threatening to destabilise Austria, combined with the rising powers in Germany, Freud believed it was high time to move to London, where it appeared to be much more stable, at least compared to other parts of Europe. \n \n While he is known as the father of psychoanalysis, Freud has been infamous for his interesting… comments on human nature, referencing a famous Greek tragic hero and his familial relationships. In addition, it has already become an unspoken fact among many circles that the only thing that can match Freud's drive to study the human psyche and nature is his rampant libido towards mature women. Of course, with such a well known figure making a public entrance, Watson faces a conundrum; after all, rumour has it that she also has such similar pastimes…"
watson.12.a:0 "We have to contain Freud, he might stea--- I mean harm the mothers of this country!"
watson.12.b:0 "We clearly have common interests, how about cooperating on some… mutually beneficial matters?"
