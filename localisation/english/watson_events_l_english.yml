watson.1.t:0 "King George V has died!"
watson.1.d:0 "While a divisive figure in the eyes of many, the previous King of the British Empire, George V, has peacefully passed away in his sleep. After his abdication of the throne, for which Watson is now the regent, the older man settled into his title as the Duke of Windsor. There was little any opposition to the old monarchy could do, for he was largely protected by aristocratic elements of the National Teammate Front. \n \n So George V withdrew from public life, resigning himself to a comfortable and peaceful retirement in his estates, primarily the Windsor castle. This self-imposed political and public exile was a thing rarely broken, save for appearances at the Wimbledon Tennis Championship and a few other occasions. The Duke's chief physician, Lord Dawson of Penn, said only that, “The Duke's life is moving peacefully towards its close.” and remarked further that the Duke had passed.” When word was brought to Watson all the regent had to say was:"
watson.1.a:0 "“A good man, a great tragedy.”"
watson.1.b:0 "“Good Riddance!”"
watson.1.c:0 "“Who?”"

watson.2.t:0 "Antarctic Expedition Returns!"
watson.2.d:0 "Brave and daring Teammate explorers have returned from their Graham Land Expedition! The survey team privately volunteered to explore the distant, icy wasteland; setting off in the year 1934. They received small scientific grants from the Watson administration, specifically from the London Geographical Society and the Colonial Office. A lesser amount of money came from private sponsors and drives. The expedition used these scant funds to purchase an old three masted ship, the majority of the being remarkable volunteers all opting out of pay in order to pursue this admirable goal. \n \n  The expedition was a remarkable success, thanks in large part to the use of experienced sled dogs and aerial survey by biplane. The biplane (model de Havilland Fox Moth), piloted primarily by second-in-command and chief pilot W.E Hampton, proved to be a key figure in the expedition, their aerial reconnaissance being important in determining that the Graham Land is a peninsula, not an island. Hampton has been hired into the Teammate air force as an advisor, his experience in difficult weather conditions and aerial scouting solidifying his role."

watson.3.t:0 "Disaster at Holditch Colliery"
watson.3.d:0 "As the black smoke rose over Staffordshire, wives wept and children mourned, for a terrible disaster had befallen the workers of Holditch Coal Mine. It initially began with a fire in the lower reaches of the mines that was quickly detected by miners Herman Payne and William Beardmore. The two miners alerted the crew of the dangers below. This fire spread rapidly, and threatened the lives of the 55 miners who were inside. The bold and daring crew gathered their gear and rallied to fend off the fires that were crawling up from the depths. \n \n  However valiantly the crew fought, the fire seemed to be undefeatable. Mr. John Davies, a manager of the mine, drafted a plan, one which would have been successful in containing the fire and the firedamp (flammable gas) explosions. His plan called for the erecting of two stopping dams in stable ground that was closer to the entrance, which stifled the fires air flow and made it so material could be brought quicker. However upon the arrival of Mr. John Cocks, managing director of the mine, the plan was changed. This new plan called for erecting three dams in unstable ground. This was further from the entrance which resulted in material being brought in slower while also allowing air and fuel to flow to the fire. This was done in order to protect the coal reserves underground from being consumed in the fire, which would have hampered profits. Due to this gross failure by management, 30 people have perished and 8 were severely wounded. Now the people of England look to see what Watson will do."
watson.3.a:0 "Let us aid in the cleanup efforts."
watson.3.b:0 "We must reprimand Management!"
watson.3.c:0 "The workers should have been more careful."

watson.10.t:0 “The Establishment of the BBC Television Service”
watson.10.d:0 "After the Great War, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was created by Amelia Watson to bring order and stability over the messy post-war landscape by allowing the population to be more informed on the happenings of the nation. However, the BBC had primarily conducted its programming in radio form. Nonetheless, plans had been in the works for a while to bring an expansion of the BBC into the newly burgeoning television market, and today it has finally been established as the BBC Television Service. \n \n Of course, what remains now is what the main focus of its television programs should be. To that end, Watson has identified three ways for the BC Television Service to function. Firstly, as the BBC is state-owned, it could be focused on stabilising and promoting the current regime. Secondly, Watson could allow for the BBC Television Service to adopt a more neutral stance on the various issues of the country, to foster the development of democracy. A third option is to make it an entertainment channel primarily, leaving the news programmes to be covered by the radio. This new venture would then help in entertaining and raising the spirits of the British people, as well as honouring a particular patron of Watson. \n \n After a long period of thinking on which direction to choose, Watson finally decided that:"
watson.10.a:0 "State-owned means state-run, glory to me!"
watson.10.b:0 "Let’s give the old “freedom of speech” a try, make it neutral."
watson.10.c:0 "Baker Street better than Cable Street, innit? Let's bring entertainment to the masses."

watson.11.t:0 “Foundation of the Women’s Voluntary Service”
watson.11.d:0 "While the origins of Amelia Watson are unknown, her first publicly known appearance was as a combat medic and nurse in the Second Boer War. Due to her efforts in that war, she was awarded the Order of Merit. \n \n Thanks to these services, it is perhaps no surprise that it was Watson who proposed the idea of the Women’s Voluntary Service. This would be an extended section of the existing Civil Defense Service, whose duty is to prepare the British population from any threats and assist them if need be. Given the deteriorating geopolitical situation, everyone, including women, would need to play their part to prepare for a future conflict. Many observers, including various progressive factions in the country, applaud the service’s founding, noting that it could lead to further developments in gender equality."
watson.11.a:0 "Now everyone can do their part!"

watson.12.t:0 “Freud Arrives in London”
watson.12.d:0 "The famous psychiatrist Sigmund Freud has moved to London today, seeking to escape from the chaos that was destabilising his homeland. Freud believed it was time to move to somewhere much more stable, at least compared to other parts of Europe. \n \n While he is publicly known as the father of psychoanalysis, privately Freud has been infamous for his controversial comments on human nature. In fact, it is already an open secret that the only thing that can match Freud's drive to study the human psyche is his rampant libido towards mature women. Of course, with the entrance of such an infamous figure, Watson faces a conundrum; after all, rumour has it that she also has similar interests…"
watson.12.a:0 "We have to contain Freud, he might stea--- I mean harm the mothers of this country!"
watson.12.b:0 "We clearly have common interests, how about cooperating on some… mutually beneficial matters?"
