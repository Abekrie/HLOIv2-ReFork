NOE_noel_shirogane: "Shirogane Noel"
NOE_noel_shirogane_desc: "Shirogane Noel is the queen of former Prussia, encompassing Northwest Germany,  and parts of Poland and the Baltics. Her doting and chivalrous nature has earned the respect of many German militarists and former Freikorps, while her autocratic rule is the ire of more liberal minded Germans and the Polish population.\n\nNoel secured power in Northern Germany after the Treaty of Brugg, making her the queen of former Prussia. She reinstated feudalism to appease the wealthy merchants and landed aristocrats to keep power and maintained a strong standing army to keep the militarists happy. Noel's large army became an asset at the onset of the Great Northern War against Fubuki though, and after the conflict was resolved with decisive battles in Noel's favour and a forced armistice by Yagoo, Noel came out of the war much stronger while disgracing Fubuki.\n\nThe Great Depression hit Noel's fiefdom hard as agricultural exports suffered, causing strife amongst the peasantry, most notably the Polish. Fubuki is also currently licking her wounds and seeks to avenge the loss of the Great Northern War. Noel now must contend with continuing to appease the aristocracy or ending neo-feudalism to restore stability to her nation."

noel.1.t:0 "Rise of the Gentry"
noel.1.d:0 "Despite the circumstances that the majority Polish population face, many have managed to obtain positions of great wealth and power without noble titles. This new class of people, the ziemianie, now make up a considerable population block and are strongly opposed to serfdom and feudalism. They generally lean towards more populist, liberal and democratic ideas but still have sympathies towards Noel and her supporters. As the ziemianie grows, their desire for political representation grows as they see the 3rd Estate "
noel.1.a:0 "An interesting development"

noel.2.t:0 "Rise of Free Farmer Communes"
noel.2.d:0 "Coinciding with the general improvement of conditions for the Polish people, more fortunate peasants have grouped up with each other to buy land and become free farmers. Unsuprisingly, they are strongly against feudalism, serfdom and in more radical factions, against Noel and the Monarchy; most are willing to resort to violence to see the end of said systems."
noel.2.a:0 "An interesting development"

noel.3.t:0 "The Trial of Herr Karsten von Schöpfer"
noel.3.d:0 "Herr Karsten von Schöpfer, born to a minor landed noble family that emerged out of the initial years of Neo-Feudom, had originally stood trial in Lublin for abusive behaviour towards his serf and was unanimously given a guilty sentence of 10 years in prison along with a hefty fine. However, this had angered much of the nobility and soon after the results were known, mass protests broke out throughout the Polish and Silesian territories. These protests demanded a full reversal of the sentence and it wasn't long until the case was sent to the High Court of Danzig for review. This places the case in a position where Noel could directly intervene in the sentencing."
noel.3.a:0 "Karsten is evidently wrong here..."
noel.3.b:0 "We'll pardon him just for once..."

noel.4.t:0 "The 11th National Council - Question of the Host City"
noel.4.d:0 "The situation in the kingdom since the Great Northern War has only grown worse with the Great Scare and Depression pummeling the rural sectors of the economy and driving the serfs to leave for the town en masse where there isn't enough jobs to keep up with the demand. Many nobles and gentlement have declared bankruptcy and have liquidated their estates; many of which are requesting government bailouts and credit to assist them. In order to address these issues, the estates in the lower and upper houses must all meet to agree on policies to fight the depression and restore order.\n Firstly, a host city must be selected for the council. Danzig and Königsberg have long been the traditional site for the council however, many from the conservative and industrialler front believe that Warsaw should host it in order to mend the relations between Germans and Poles. This would in turn, anger the Uradel Faction who would prefer a German city."
noel.4.a:0 "Danzig is lovely this time of year!"
noel.4.b:0 "Königsberg hasn't hosted since 1930!"
noel.4.c:0 "Hosting it in Warsaw would surely please the Poles!"

noel.5.t:0 "The 11th National Council - The Council Begins!"
noel.5.d:0 "The streets are bustling with peddlers and journalists. Nobles, gentlemen, peasants and cleargymen flood the main building hosting the council and take their respective seats while they wait for last of those arriving to settle down. A few minutes after the last set of representatives enter, Kaiserin Noel von Deutschland makes her appearance and makes her opening speech; stressing the importance of national unity and strength during the trying times of the depression. All but the 4th Estate of the peasantry applauded her as the estate representatives and Noel's appointed advisors outline what is to be discussed in the following days. After the final speech from Generalfeldmarschall Johannes Blaskowitz congratulating the Kaiserin for her resilience, the first day wrapped up on an enthusiastic note."
noel.5.a:0 "A wonderful start!"

noel.6.t:0 "The 11th National Council - The Serfdom Debate"
noel.6.d:0 "Serfdom was established in the territories of Silesia, Eastern Prussia and Pommerania soon after the Treaty of Brugg was signed and at the time, made only small portions of the popuation serfs. The following decade of economic turbulance forced many to become serfs in order to pay off debts or to simply find a place to live while land prices skyrocketed. Serfdom become especially commonplace after the Great Northern War and the annexation of Poland. Entire villages and towns became holdings of German nobility and officers, making many landless Poles serfs. Not to mention the exodus of Baltic People, fleeing the Fubuki National Army into East Prussia without any money or possessions; thus forcing them into serfdom as well. For all these factors, serfs make up a significant portion of the population and are disenfranchised due to their lack of political representation. These views were echoed by the gentry and peasants in the 3rd and 4th Estates who wish for a total reversal of the Neo-Feudom Policy while the nobility in the 1st Estate argue against giving the serfs more rights. \n It is without question that Noel, her advisors and the DNO must make an official stance on the policy of serfdom now."
noel.6.a:0 "Support the Industrialists and the 3rd and 4th Estates, Serfdom must be completely abolished!"
noel.6.b:0 "A compromise must be made, Serfdom must be ameliorated!"
noel.6.c:0 "The nobility is right, Serfdom must stay!"
noel.6.e:0 "Serfdom is a part of our society and will remain that way!"

noel.7.t:0 "The 11th National Council - Industrialisation?"
noel.7.d:0 "The Kingdom has focused on agriculture since the Treaty of Brugg in 1920. This dependence only expanded once serfdom became the norm by 1932. However the Great Scare and following Depression has battered our farmers, serfs and landowners and agricultural production is slumping while the urban population only grows. The Industrieller Front and much of the Council see this is as a great opportunity to expand our industry and allow for a 2nd Industrial Revolution, particularly in the Polish territories where unemployment is most rampant. However the Uradel Faction still fight back against such reform, demanding that the serfs be returned to the estates and the national government hand out loans to stimulate agriculture and allow for further modernisation.\n It is without question that Noel, her advisors and the DNO must make an official stance on industrialisation."
noel.7.a:0 "Needless to say, the Industrialists are right!"
noel.7.b:0 "Agrarianism has been our base for decades!"

noel.8.t:0 "The 11th National Council - The Military in Politics"
noel.8.d:0 "Since the formation of the Noe-Feudom State after Brugg, the Military has enjoyed the privilege of having a designated number of seats in the Lower House. This comes in the form of the Ritter Bundis who mainly compaign for a continuation of the Great Northern War, expanded conscription and veterans rights after service in the army. However, contrary to 1920s and 1931 Council, the Ritter Bundis of the 11th Council is significantly more moderate and would accept the loss of their seats if they were promised that their demands would be met by the Kaiserin and her loyalists. The rest of the council voices indifference towards the military's minimal position anyways and agree with their demands and needs.\n Despite the unanimous agreement, the Queen and her loylists must still make their stance public."
noel.8.a:0 "The Military should remain in parliament, their opinion is relevant too!"
noel.8.b:0 "If it's not broken, don't fix it."
noel.8.c:0 "We agree with the majority."

noel.9.t:0 "The 11th National Council - Bail out the Landowners?"
noel.9.d:0 "After the Great Depression, landowners and nobles began selling lands and titles en masse and even more have liquidated and declared bankruptcy. Evidently, this is causing a collapse in agricultural production and much of the nobility and Uradel Faction are pushing for the national government to bail ut these landowners. On the other hand, peasants and gentry are against the bailouts and instead support stimulous and public works to ease the suffering of the unemployed. Finally, the industrialists believe that no government action needs to be taken and the jobs created by the factories would be more sustainable than social programs in the long run.\n It is without question that Noel, her advisors and the DNO must make an official stance on the bailouts now."
noel.9.a:0 "We need to bail them out!"
noel.9.b:0 "The Industrialists are right, let them fail."
noel.9.c:0 "The 3rd and 4th Estates are right! We need public works!"

noel.10.t:0 "The Council Concludes!"
noel.10.d:0 "After days of debates, speeches, poetry and numerous attempted duels, the 11th Emergency National Council dismisses with the final speech from Noel reminding her subjects once more of the importance of loyalty and duty the to Kingdom and its people. With the entire event  being televised live as well as headlines and articles soon spilling out into regional newspapers, many potential voters for the upcoming election have been swayed by the provocative and energtic speeches made from all estates."

noel.11.t:0 "The Warsaw Conference"
noel.11.d:0 "It was roughly 8 a.m. in the morning when Kaiserin Noel received a letter of invitation to the 'Freunde des Polnischen' organisation's meeting in Warsaw later that month. The mostly German 'Freunde des Polnischen' have been vocal in their abolitionist stance and have been crucial for numerous manumission efforts around the Polish territories. Partaking in such an event would surely place Noel in the centre of the abolitionist movement."
noel.11.a:0 "The benevolent Kaiserin accepts their offer."
noel.11.b:0 "'The Kaiserin is a busy lady.'"

noel.12.t:0 "The Disintegration of Volkspartei Preußens"
noel.12.d:0 "After decades of attacks and demonstrations, the Volkspartei's Prussia branch was officially disbanded due to the collapsing support of the party in the region. Unofficial statements from former members claim that many have left for the Fatherland in Berlin and those which remained lacked the charisma of former leaders and thus, the already underground movement split into various minor and relatively harmless splinter groups."
noel.12.a:0 "Good riddence"

noel.13.t: "Officers Rally Against Noel"
noel.13.d: "As the situation deteriorates, it seems a number of military officers have turned against Noel. Divisions loyal to them have seized key areas of the country, including railway hubs, barracks, and road junctions. At a number of radio stations, they have declared Noel as an enemy of the people, officially siding with the rebels."
noel.13.a: "Could this get any worse?"

noel.14.t: "The Opposition Backs the Rebels"
noel.14.d: "After years of their proposals being shot down, and watching as the common people suffered, the political opposition has announced their support for the rebellion. Particularly the Left-Wing revolutionaries, and the Nationalists, with some members of the Conservatives and Progressives joining them."
noel.14.a: "They were only holding us back anyway…"

noel.15.t: "The Talk of the Town"
noel.15.d: "The deterioration of the country is reaching a breaking point. Unless we further prepare, we will stand no chance in the event of a revolution"
noel.15.a: "We must ramp up our preparation!"

noel.19.t: "Noelkorp Armed and Serfs Gathered"
noel.19.d: "As the civil war continues, we have decided to arm the Noelkorps for the defence of the nation. As well as this, we have gathered the loyal serfs we can find, in order to have them ramp up food production, and to conscript them into the army."
noel.19.a: "Desperate times call for desperate measures…"

noel.20.t: "Noelkorp Armed and Serfs Gathered"
noel.20.d: "As the civil war continues, we have decided to arm the Noelkorps for the defence of the nation. As well as this, we have gathered the loyal serfs we can find, in order to have them ramp up food production, and to conscript them into the army."
noel.20.a: "Desperate times call for desperate measures…"

noel.21.t: "Serfs Gathered"
noel.21.d: "To supplement our losses, we have gathered all the serfs of loyal nobility in order to conscript a number of them into the army. As well as this, their food production quotas have doubled, in order to feed our armies and people"
noel.21.a: "The nation's survival will show why they must work"

noel.22.t: "The Noelkorps Armed"
noel.22.d: "As the fighting escalates across the country, we have been forced to rely on the Noelkorps. We have armed them, and sent them to fight on the frontlines alongside our troops. Being made up of veterans and hardened nationalists, their experience and loyalty has proven vital"
noel.22.a: "They shall lead us to victory!"

noel.23.t: "Citizens armed, Serfs gathered, Noelkorp armed"
noel.23.d: "With the country having fallen to civil war, we have mobilised every man and woman still loyal to us in order to aid in the war effort. Citizens have been formed into armed militias, serfs have been ordered to increase their agricultural production, as well as being conscripted into the army. Even the paramilitary Noelkorp has been armed to fight on the frontlines."
noel.23.a: "Anyone who can hold a rifle must fight!"

noel.24.t: "Start the Revolution"
noel.24.d: "The time has finally come. For too long has the bourgeoisie trampled on the rights of the workers. For too long have the serfs toiled away on plantations that have held them there as slaves, and for too long has the gridlocked government turned a blind eye. For months we have prepared, gathering weapons, and placing our most devout followers in key locations, awaiting the order to strike. When the signal is given, the revolution shall begin…"
noel.24.a: "It is time to break the chains!"

noel.25.t: "Trial of the Collaborators"
noel.25.d: "With the civil war now over, we can now punish those responsible. For their treachery, generals who have fought alongside the rebels now stand on trial. As each one gives their testimonies, we must decide what we must do with them. We can either punish them, by either imprisoning them, or even executing them for treason. Or we can pardon them for their crimes, and let them stay within the military, as their experience may prove useful"
noel.25.a: "There is no mercy for traitors. Hang them for treason"
noel.25.b: "They can prove useful in the future. Pardon them for their crimes."

noel.26.t: "End of the Civil War"
noel.26.d: "After harsh fighting, the last holdouts of resistance have been finally stamped out. With the civil war over, and the rebellion crushed, we can now focus on our efforts to rebuild the country. We also must reform our government, to ensure something like this never happens again"
noel.26.a: "Peace…at last"

noel.27.t: "The Luttwitz Proposals"
noel.27.d: "After much debate within the Reichstag, we have decided to adopt the Luttwitz Proposals. A series of reforms that will improve the working conditions of the serfs, while not entirely setting them free. This way, we can maintain the status quo, while satisfying members of the opposition."
noel.27.a: "Politics is a balancing act."

noel.28.t:0 "Flare's Spirits"
noel.28.d:0 "A recent trade deal has been made, as our country begins importing medical spirits from Flare. With this, we can aid our wounded men on the frontlines, and it is especially needed after the civil war."
noel.28.a:0 "The first step to a greater relationship."
noel.28.b:0 "The first step to a greater relationship."

noel.29.t: "Flare Accepts Faction Offer"
noel.29.d: "Our neighbour Flare has agreed to the formal creation of a military alliance. Not only do we now have a new ally, but we also have a greater gateway into the lands of Eastern Europe."
noel.29.a: "For our mutual security and peace."

noel.30.t: "Flare Turns Down Our Offer"
noel.30.d: "For whatever reason, Flare has refused our offer for a military pact. This has sparked outrage, from both our government, and members of the common public."
noel.30.a: "Their loss I suppose…"

noel.31.t: "Flare Refuses Our Offer"
noel.31.d: "Our diplomatic mission from our neighbour Flare has arrived today. It is revealed that Flare has refused to submit to our reign, and has begun to mobilise should we act rashly."
noel.31.a: "Leave them be…for now."
noel.31.b: "They shall pay for this! Declare war!"

noel.32.t: "Flare Accepts Our Offer"
noel.32.d: "In a historic moment, Flare has agreed to submit her nation to our rule. The people celebrate the new union between our countries and Noel has announced a close collaboration to aid in the expansion of Flare's military and economy."
noel.32.a: "Our bonds are now unbreakable!"

noel.33.t: "Rommel Returns"
noel.33.d: "As war wages against Flare, one of our most skilled generals, Erwin Rommel, has returned from being an attache to Flare's army. His knowledge will prove vital, as for months he has studied how Flare's army works. With this, we can learn how to defeat Noel on the frontlines"
noel.33.a: "Let us put his knowledge to use."

noel.34.t: "Rommel Returns"
noel.34.d: "Watching as Flare's armies lay down their arms in surrender, our attache Erwin Rommel has returned. For months, he has worked closely with Flare's army, studying how they fought on the frontlines. With this knowledge, we can now learn how they lost against this current foe, and prepare for any inevitable invasion."
noel.34.a: "He shall lead our nation's defence."

noel.35.t: "The Final Ultimatum"
noel.35.d: "As our armies are now ready, we can now focus on the rest of former Germany. As our eyes wander south, we must decide how we must deal with Kiara. We can either peacefully offer incorporation for Kiara, or declare war."
noel.35.a: "Send a message, asking for incorporation."
noel.35.b: "Forget peace, our reconquest begins now!"

noel.36.t: "The German Question"
noel.36.d: "The rogue state that claims to be Germany has been a thorn in our side for years. They hold the ancestral Prussian capital of Berlin, and they stand between us, and the other German speaking lands. We must now decide what to do with these so-called remnants of Germany."
noel.36.a: "Strike while we have the element of surprise!"

noel.37.t: "Kiara Refuses Our Offer"
noel.37.d: "Having sent a message to Kiara to demand her nation's incorporation into the new German state, we received her response. She has officially refused our offer of peaceful integration, prompting the government to decide what action must be taken."

noel.37.a: "We are not ready for war. Send a diplomatic protest."

noel.38.t: "Kiara Accepts Our Offer"

noel.39.a: "Deutschland über Alles!"

noel.40.t: "Austria Accepts Our Offer"
noel.40.d: "Today, Austria has agreed to join the new German state. As our nations share a common language, it would make sense that they join their German brothers in a national union, just as they did over a hundred years ago in the German Confederation."
noel.40.a: "Germanic brothers, together again."

noel.41.t: "Austria Refuses Our Offer"
noel.41.d: "Outrage today, as in spite of our common language and culture, Austria has refused to unite with our German state. This has prompted Noel and her officers to debate on what must be done against this action"

noel.41.b: "Leave them be…for now."

noel.42.t: "Subaru Refuses"
noel.42.d: "With our unification of Germany nearly complete, we turn our eyes to the last breakaway state, the Benelux region controlled by Subaru.

noel.42.a: "Our unification is nearly complete. March and retake our lands!"
noel.42.b: "Leave them be, until we are ready to fight."

noel.43.t: "Subaru Accepts Our Offer"

noel.44.t: "Subaru Hands Over Luxembourg"
noel.44.d: "Much to our surprise, Subaru has also decided to hand over the territory of Luxembourg to us as well."
noel.44.a: "A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."

noel.45.t: "Subaru Rescinds Her Offer"
noel.45.d: "We have just received a message from Subaru. She has denied giving us Luxembourg, and more outrageous, has denied handing over us our rightful German lands."
noel.45.a: "We will make them pay for this outrage!"
noel.45.b: "“We cannot wage war on them. Send a diplomatic protest."

noel.46.t: "Subaru Counter-Offers"
noel.46.d: "We have received word from Subaru regarding the demand of our German lands. She has agreed to hand over German territory, while at the same time has also agreed to allow our troops to move within their country, and to negotiate a non-aggression pact"

noel.47.t: "Subaru Denies German land for Concessions"
noel.47.d: "Not only has Subaru denied our German lands, but she has also not agreed to our concessions of letting troops move within their country, and has refused to sign a non-aggression pact"
noel.47.a: "“Let them think they won. We will be back."
noel.47.b: "This outrage cannot go unanswered!"

noel.48.t: "Subaru Accepts Our Offers"
noel.48.d: "Our neighbour Subaru has agreed to formally joining our military alliance. Not only will this give us further access to the North Sea and English Channel, but we also have a way through the Benelux, and into France"

noel.49.t: "Subaru Refuses Our Offer"
noel.49.d: "Subaru has refused to join our alliance, barring us from access to the Benelux region, and further access to the English channel"

noel.50.t: "Suisei Accepts Our Offer"
noel.50.d: "In the news today, Suisei has agreed to join our faction, solidifying our close relations. With Suisei now on our side, we have access to the Mediterranean, a border with Pekora, and a larger border with the French National State."
noel.50.a: "Frenchmen and Germans now friends?"

noel.51.t: "Suisei Refuses Our Offer"
noel.51.d: "Suisei has refused to join our alliance, sparking outrage from Noel and her government. Without her, we must now depend on Pekora for our access to the Mediterranean and Southern France."
noel.51.a: "We will not forget this."

noel.52.t: "Pekora Accepts Our Offer"
noel.52.d: "Our influence now spreads further as Pekora has joined our faction, giving us access to most of the Italian peninsula and further thanks to Pekora's African holdings. Now our navy can operate outside of European waters, and our manpower is now bolstered by Pekora's empire."
noel.52.a: "Nowhere in the world is beyond our reach"

noel.56.t: "Pekora Refuses Our Offer"
noel.56.d: "Much to our disappointment, Pekora has refused to join our faction. Not only have we lost access to the Mediterranean, but elsewhere as we cannot access her African colonies."
noel.56.a: "Who needs Pekora as an ally anyways?"

noel.54.t: "Elbing Proposals"
noel.54.d: "In order to satisfy the progressives and conservatives within our government, we have made the Elbing proposals as a compromise. While not outright banning Serfdom, it will limit the amount of farms allowed to use Serfdom. This way, both sides are satisfied"
noel.54.a: "Sometimes sitting on the fence works."

noel.55.t: "Motke vs Muller"
noel.55.d: "What started as a spark of discontent has now grown into a massive all consuming flame. Reports of uprisings have begun arriving from all over the country, as those opposed to Noel's government declare their intentions to overthrow it. Our armies have begun to mobilise, as Noel and her government flee for safety"
noel.55.a: "Perhaps God really is with us…"
noel.55.b: "One side will triumph on this day."

noel.57.t: "Aloe Demands West Galicia"
noel.57.d: "Aloe has made a claim on our territory of West Galicia, which we inhabited from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This region made of mostly ethnic Poles and Ruthenians serves as our vital border to the South. Surrendering it will make us more vulnerable, but it may also improve relations with Aloe."
noel.57.a: "Sure! Here you go"
noel.57.a: "Absolutely Not"
