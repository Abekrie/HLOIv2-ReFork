noel.1.t:0 "Rise of the Gentry"
noel.1.d:0 "Despite the circumstances that the majority Polish population face, many have managed to obtain positions of great wealth and power without noble titles. This new class of people, the ziemianie, now make up a considerable population block and are strongly opposed to serfdom and feudalism. They generally lean towards more populist, liberal and democratic ideas but still have sympathies towards Noel and her supporters. As the ziemianie grows, their desire for political representation grows as they see the 3rd Estate "
noel.1.a:0 "An interesting development"

noel.2.t:0 "Rise of Free Farmer Communes"
noel.2.d:0 "Coinciding with the general improvement of conditions for the Polish people, more fortunate peasants have grouped up with each other to buy land and become free farmers. Unsuprisingly, they are strongly against feudalism, serfdom and in more radical factions, against Noel and the Monarchy; most are willing to resort to violence to see the end of said systems."
noel.2.a:0 "An interesting development"

noel.3.t:0 "The Trial of Herr Karsten von Schöpfer"
noel.3.d:0 "Herr Karsten von Schöpfer, born to a minor landed noble family that emerged out of the initial years of Neo-Feudom, had originally stood trial in Lublin for abusive behaviour towards his serf and was unanimously given a guilty sentence of 10 years in prison along with a hefty fine. However, this had angered much of the nobility and soon after the results were known, mass protests broke out throughout the Polish and Silesian territories. These protests demanded a full reversal of the sentence and it wasn't long until the case was sent to the High Court of Danzig for review. This places the case in a position where Noel could directly intervene in the sentencing."
noel.3.a:0 "Karsten is evidently wrong here..."
noel.3.b:0 "We'll pardon him just for once..."

noel.4.t:0 "The 11th National Council - Question of the Host City"
noel.4.d:0 "The situation in the kingdom since the Great Northern War has only grown worse with the Great Scare and Depression pummeling the rural sectors of the economy and driving the serfs to leave for the town en masse where there isn't enough jobs to keep up with the demand. Many nobles and gentlement have declared bankruptcy and have liquidated their estates; many of which are requesting government bailouts and credit to assist them. In order to address these issues, the estates in the lower and upper houses must all meet to agree on policies to fight the depression and restore order.\n Firstly, a host city must be selected for the council. Danzig and Königsberg have long been the traditional site for the council however, many from the conservative and industrialler front believe that Warsaw should host it in order to mend the relations between Germans and Poles. This would in turn, anger the Uradel Faction who would prefer a German city."
noel.4.a:0 "Danzig is lovely this time of year!"
noel.4.b:0 "Königsberg hasn't hosted since 1930!"
noel.4.c:0 "Hosting it in Warsaw would surely please the Poles!"

noel.5.t:0 "The 11th National Council - The Council Begins!"
noel.5.d:0 "The streets are bustling with peddlers and journalists. Nobles, gentlemen, peasants and cleargymen flood the main building hosting the council and take their respective seats while they wait for last of those arriving to settle down. A few minutes after the last set of representatives enter, Kaiserin Noel von Deutschland makes her appearance and makes her opening speech; stressing the importance of national unity and strength during the trying times of the depression. All but the 4th Estate of the peasantry applauded her as the estate representatives and Noel's appointed advisors outline what is to be discussed in the following days. After the final speech from Generalfeldmarschall Johannes Blaskowitz congratulating the Kaiserin for her resilience, the first day wrapped up on an enthusiastic note."
noel.5.a:0 "A wonderful start!"

noel.6.t:0 "The 11th National Council - The Serfdom Debate"
noel.6.d:0 "Serfdom was established in the territories of Silesia, Eastern Prussia and Pommerania soon after the Treaty of Brugg was signed and at the time, made only small portions of the popuation serfs. The following decade of economic turbulance forced many to become serfs in order to pay off debts or to simply find a place to live while land prices skyrocketed. Serfdom become especially commonplace after the Great Northern War and the annexation of Poland. Entire villages and towns became holdings of German nobility and officers, making many landless Poles serfs. Not to mention the exodus of Baltic People, fleeing the Fubuki National Army into East Prussia without any money or possessions; thus forcing them into serfdom as well. For all these factors, serfs make up a significant portion of the population and are disenfranchised due to their lack of political representation. These views were echoed by the gentry and peasants in the 3rd and 4th Estates who wish for a total reversal of the Neo-Feudom Policy while the nobility in the 1st Estate argue against giving the serfs more rights. \n It is without question that Noel, her advisors and the DNO must make an official stance on the policy of serfdom now."
noel.6.a:0 "Support the Industrialists and the 3rd and 4th Estates, Serfdom must be completely abolished!"
noel.6.b:0 "A compromise must be made, Serfdom must be ameliorated!"
noel.6.c:0 "The nobility is right, Serfdom must stay!"
noel.6.e:0 "Serfdom is a part of our society and will remain that way!"

noel.7.t:0 "The 11th National Council - Industrialisation?"
noel.7.d:0 "The Kingdom has focused on agriculture since the Treaty of Brugg in 1920. This dependence only expanded once serfdom became the norm by 1932. However the Great Scare and following Depression has battered our farmers, serfs and landowners and agricultural production is slumping while the urban population only grows. The Industrieller Front and much of the Council see this is as a great opportunity to expand our industry and allow for a 2nd Industrial Revolution, particularly in the Polish territories where unemployment is most rampant. However the Uradel Faction still fight back against such reform, demanding that the serfs be returned to the estates and the national government hand out loans to stimulate agriculture and allow for further modernisation.\n It is without question that Noel, her advisors and the DNO must make an official stance on industrialisation."
noel.7.a:0 "Needless to say, the Industrialists are right!"
noel.7.b:0 "Agrarianism has been our base for decades!"

noel.8.t:0 "The 11th National Council - The Military in Politics"
noel.8.d:0 "Since the formation of the Noe-Feudom State after Brugg, the Military has enjoyed the privilege of having a designated number of seats in the Lower House. This comes in the form of the Ritter Bundis who mainly compaign for a continuation of the Great Northern War, expanded conscription and veterans rights after service in the army. However, contrary to 1920s and 1931 Council, the Ritter Bundis of the 11th Council is significantly more moderate and would accept the loss of their seats if they were promised that their demands would be met by the Kaiserin and her loyalists. The rest of the council voices indifference towards the military's minimal position anyways and agree with their demands and needs.\n Despite the unanimous agreement, the Queen and her loylists must still make their stance public."
noel.8.a:0 "The Military should remain in parliament, their opinion is relevant too!"
noel.8.b:0 "If it's not broken, don't fix it."
noel.8.c:0 "We agree with the majority."

noel.9.t:0 "The 11th National Council - Bail out the Landowners?"
noel.9.d:0 "After the Great Depression, landowners and nobles began selling lands and titles en masse and even more have liquidated and declared bankruptcy. Evidently, this is causing a collapse in agricultural production and much of the nobility and Uradel Faction are pushing for the national government to bail ut these landowners. On the other hand, peasants and gentry are against the bailouts and instead support stimulous and public works to ease the suffering of the unemployed. Finally, the industrialists believe that no government action needs to be taken and the jobs created by the factories would be more sustainable than social programs in the long run.\n It is without question that Noel, her advisors and the DNO must make an official stance on the bailouts now."
noel.9.a:0 "We need to bail them out!"
noel.9.b:0 "The Industrialists are right, let them fail."
noel.9.c:0 "The 3rd and 4th Estates are right! We need public works!"

noel.10.t:0 "The Council Concludes!"
noel.10.d:0 "After days of debates, speeches, poetry and numerous attempted duels, the 11th Emergency National Council dismisses with the final speech from Noel reminding her subjects once more of the importance of loyalty and duty the to Kingdom and its people. With the entire event  being televised live as well as headlines and articles soon spilling out into regional newspapers, many potential voters for the upcoming election have been swayed by the provocative and energtic speeches made from all estates."

noel.11.t:0 "The Warsaw Conference"
noel.11.d:0 "It was roughly 8 a.m. in the morning when Kaiserin Noel received a letter of invitation to the 'Freunde des Polnischen' organisation's meeting in Warsaw later that month. The mostly German 'Freunde des Polnischen' have been vocal in their abolitionist stance and have been crucial for numerous manumission efforts around the Polish territories. Partaking in such an event would surely place Noel in the centre of the abolitionist movement."
noel.11.a:0 "The benevolent Kaiserin accepts their offer."
noel.11.b:0 "'The Kaiserin is a busy lady.'"

noel.12.t:0 "The Disintegration of Volkspartei Preußens"
noel.12.d:0 "After decades of attacks and demonstrations, the Volkspartei's Prussia branch was officially disbanded due to the collapsing support of the party in the region. Unofficial statements from former members claim that many have left for the Fatherland in Berlin and those which remained lacked the charisma of former leaders and thus, the already underground movement split into various minor and relatively harmless splinter groups."
noel.12.a:0 "Good riddence"

noel.28.t:0 "Noel imports spirits from Flare"
noel.28.d:0 "She likes alcohol lmao"
noel.28.a:0 "Im flare and im glad noel is taking my alcohol"
noel.28.b:0 "Im Noel and im making an investment into flare's economy"
