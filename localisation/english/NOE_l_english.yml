NOE_noel_shirogane: "Shirogane Noel"
NOE_noel_shirogane_desc: "Shirogane Noel is the queen of former Prussia, encompassing Northwest Germany,  and parts of Poland and the Baltics. Her doting and chivalrous nature has earned the respect of many German militarists and former Freikorps, while her autocratic rule is the ire of more liberal minded Germans and the Polish population.\n\nNoel secured power in Northern Germany after the Treaty of Brugg, making her the queen of former Prussia. She reinstated feudalism to appease the wealthy merchants and landed aristocrats to keep power and maintained a strong standing army to keep the militarists happy. Noel's large army became an asset at the onset of the Great Northern War against Fubuki though, and after the conflict was resolved with decisive battles in Noel's favour and a forced armistice by Yagoo, Noel came out of the war much stronger while disgracing Fubuki.\n\nThe Great Depression hit Noel's fiefdom hard as agricultural exports suffered, causing strife amongst the peasantry, most notably the Polish. Fubuki is also currently licking her wounds and seeks to avenge the loss of the Great Northern War. Noel now must contend with continuing to appease the aristocracy or ending neo-feudalism to restore stability to her nation."
