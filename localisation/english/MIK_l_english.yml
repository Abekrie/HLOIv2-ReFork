MIK_sakura_miko: "Sakura Miko"
MIK_sakura_miko_desc: "Sakura Miko is the “elite” queen of Spain and an aristocrat through and through. Despite her questionable intelligence at times, her sense of humour and unifying authority has prevented Spain from entering a civil war multiple times. The right regard Miko as a traditionalist authority figure that keeps the stability of the nation, while the left considers Miko a queen of the people who spearheaded multiple farming initiatives that alleviated the Great Depression, and pushed for workers rights.\n\nDespite being a queen, Sakura Miko's beginnings were rather humble; she lived with a peasant family on arrival to the past and worked as a farmhand with them. When the Great War broke out and the Hololive Revolution began, she heeded Yagoo's call to arms and joined as a leading figure in the revolutionary forces in Spain. She mostly spent her time robbing banks to build her wealth and accidentally starting fires wherever she went however. A great power vacuum occurred in Spain post-Brugg, and with both Miko's charisma, right timing and a good amount of LHS assistance she took control of the Spanish Republic. Miko re-wrote the constitution that made her queen of Spain, which aligned her with the right but quickly alienated the left. She made concessions to the left by initiating socialist policies that genuinely aided the poor, and she became the uniting figure of both sides of the aisle.\n\nSpain currently sits rather stable in the world, but Sakura Miko was suddenly struck by a mysterious illness and put into a coma. Without the guidance of their queen, the opposing forces of Spanish politics are beginning to draw their swords at each other once again. Nevertheless, both sides agree that to go to war is to betray the trust of the Elite Queen and as such, they both sit and build power in the background while awaiting for Miko to awake from her slumber."
