CHC_choco_yuzuki_desc: "Yuzuki Choco is the de-facto leader of former French Indochina, recognized by the LHS. Her natural beauty, seductive personality and kind nature along with her philanthropic charity work has made her rather popular with the urban populations of Vietnam. She rules the former colonial region in the standardized LHS republican model as per the wishes of Yagoo.\n\nChoco's beginning in French Indochina was one of kindness and charity; she saw the suffering of the Vietnamese people under French oppression and cooperated with local Buddhist monasteries and Catholic churches to provide free healthcare to the local populace along with education to poor children. When the Hololive Revolution kicked off in Europe, the fall of France left the Indochinese government stranded. Using this opportunity, Choco allied herself with the VNQDD and seized power in the disjointed government and proclaimed loyalty to Yagoo and the LHS. Her government however was in conflict with numerous independence groups in the region.\n\nThe largest threat to Choco's rule is the Viet Minh, a Vietnamese nationalist guerrilla movement lead by Ho Chi Minh that seeks to liberate Vietnam from foreign and LHS rule. Although Choco maintains control over the cities, the Viet Minh dominate the countryside and remote areas of her lands while proving to be well trained and ferocious fighters that outclass Choco's. Outside of the Viet Minh, other smaller militias and criminal elements such as the Caodaists, armed Catholics, and the Binh Xuyen, alongside smaller militant nationalist Cambodian and Laotian groups serve as thorns on Choco's side. If Choco is to survive, she has to pick and choose allies to win over and eradicate chosen enemies. Most importantly, she must continue with her strong hearts and minds policy to continue building Indochina into a strong and prosperous nation."
