ZTA_vestia_zeta: "Vestia Zeta"
ZTA_vestia_zeta_desc: "Vestia Zeta is the governor of Aceh. Despite her protests, Zeta's cat-like attitude draws her followers to her, and the ascendant ideology of Zeta Futurism holds together her followers in a belief for a greater future for mankind beyond Indonesia.\n\nZeta stayed with a poor family when she traveled back in time and not soon after hopped onto a boat for better opportunities outside of Indonesia. She ended up going to Italy where she met Moona and Pekora, where she learned oratory skills and ideological fervor from the latter. She also happened to discover Italian Futurism, but didn't understand too much so she made her own ideology based off of it. She returned home to Indonesia and participated in the general uprising that overthrew the Dutch colonial government, installing herself as Sultana of Aceh where she then established the ZEUG (Zeta Earth Union Group) to preach her ideology.\n\nZeta's ZEUG is a group that wishes to encompass all of humanity, not just Indonesia. Zeta believes that humanity is meant for greater things than to just stay on Earth; humanity is to be united and ascend towards the stars. However before Zeta can bring the ZEUG's lofty goals to the world, she must first secure her position in Indonesia and break out of her holding in Aceh."
