KRO_ouro_kronii_desc: "Ouro Kronii is the despot of the Vologdan Oblast, also known as the Kronii Oblast by the Kingdom of Fubuki, or colloquially “Bunkeronii” by Kronii's subjects. The cold, harsh conditions of the land, the endless migrations of the people and the constant threats of war have made Kronii as cynical woman that has no qualms in using heavy handed, authoritarian methods to get the job done.\n\nKronii originally governed Poland after the Hololive Revolution but was defeated by Noel in a swift invasion. She packed up her belongings and took along a sizable number of followers, retreating in exile eastwards towards Flare's lands. She was forced to flee further East when Flare announced her loyalties to Noel, and even further after Rushia was forced to displace her refugees at the threats from Noel and Flare. After the Great Northern War ended, Fubuki granted safe passage for Kronii and her refugees, allowing them to set up by encampments in the Urals bordering the Russian Socialist Republic.\n\nKronii currently must contend with a poor geographic position, sandwiched between 2 giant states. Although Fubuki offers Kronii protection her eyes are currently focused on Noel and the RSR is eyeing for conquest. Kronii must organise her people and create a new nation from nothing, lest she be ground to dust and forgotten by history."
