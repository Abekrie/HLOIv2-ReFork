 global_holo.1.d: "The ongoing global struggle between Usada Kensetsu, Akukin Kensetsu, and Oozora Kensetsu has officially gone hot as the three nations have declared war on each other over several global disputes in developing nations, primarily in Africa. The Construction Wars, as experts call it, is a conflict between interconnected private and state owned construction companies of Pekora, Aqua, and Subaru who have overlapping political and economic interests across developing nations. Although this war is one between Pekora, Aqua and Subaru respectively, it is unknown if the war will be escalated and Resistance and LHS will be pulled in."

 global_holo.2.t: "The Campo War"
 global_holo.2.desc: "In the years after Kanata took power in Mexico and declared the Heimin Union, she acquired loans from Coco to rebuild the Mexican economy. However when the Great Depression hit, the price of tropical fruits fell and agrarian reform in Mexico caused Kanata's economy to fall into a financial crisis. Kanata assumed her good friend Coco would give her leeway for her debt but Coco instead invaded Kanata into 1934, militarily occupying Northern Mexico and forced her to cede Veracruz as collateral until Kanata is able to repay her debts. The LHS also sent a “peacekeeping force” to take control of Baja California and occupied it to this day.\n\nKanata has declared war against Coco on the grounds of national liberation, intending to retake Northern Mexico and the port city of Veracruz that Coco has occupied as debt collateral. Only time will tell who will come out on top."

 global_holo.4.t: "The Yagoo Council"
 global_holo.4.international: "Yagoo and the LHS have announced a new policy of internationalism in the latest LHS Global Council conference. Yagoo has stated the importance of reaffirming and maintaining LHS cultural and political doctrine worldwide in accordance with the 'Seiso' tenets of Hololive established during the Treaty of Brugg.  The LHS as a whole will now seek to actively take part in global affairs concerning the global prosperity of the LHS and its member states, including but not limited to economic aid and military assistance in global conflicts and insurgencies. The LHS's new global commitments have brought confidence to pro-LHS states seeking further assistance from Yagoo, and have drawn the concern and ire of the Resistance who have long opposed the LHS's globalist worldviews."
 global_holo.4.regional: "Yagoo and the LHS have announced an updated policy of Hololiver regionalism in the latest LHS Global Council conference. Yagoo has reaffirmed the promotion of LHS 'Seiso' policies in the nations and territories controlled by pro-LHS states around the globe, stating that the development of localised 'idol-like' policies in adherence to the Seiso ideal will lead to continued global prosperity. He has also urged the continuation of further industrialization around the globe that will lead to global welfare under the LHS umbrella. The LHS's new announcements on regionalism have brought assurance to pro-LHS states towing the Yagooist line, while the Resistance continues to spit upon the LHS's sanitization of idol freedom and international suffrage of workers."
 global_holo.4.national: "Yagoo and the LHS have announced a new updated edict in regards to Hololiver nationalism in the latest LHS Global Council conference. Hololive nationalism has been a new development in the politics of many nations around the world, where nationalism of countries is becoming increasingly linked with the Hololiver herself. Yagoo and the LHS has recently promoted this development, stating that nations of the world have the right to be proud of the idol leading their nation, which will in turn promote national unity and global cooperation under the umbrella of the LHS. The LHS's new policies on nationalism have been well received by pro-LHS states who trust their oshis, while the Resistance remains suspicious or outright hostile to the LHS's new claims to idol nationalism, believing that Yagoo preaches 'fake' nationalism to keep Hololivers complacent with LHS globalism."

 global_holo.6.t: "Islamic Revival"
 global_holo.6.desc: "News of a massive armed uprising in Korone's territory has quickly surfaced. What started out as a series of localised revolts escalated into a large-scale uprising across the entirety of the Arabian Peninsula. The kings and sultans of the Arabian Peninsula who have assembled to oppose Korone have set aside their petty differences and combined forces with local religious anti-Korone militias to remove Korone's sovereignty over Arabia. The rebel force claims that their movement is both a nationalist and religious force that seeks to repel the “Dog Invader” from their lands and restore local rule."

 global_holo.7.desc: "Today Hoshimachi Suisei announced a new national policy to the world in regards to the governance of Suisei's territory of France. The national government of Suisei has shifted to a monarchy as of today, crowning Hoshimachi Suisei as the Empress of France. The coronation of Hoshimachi Suisei was a grand one at the Palace of Versailles, followed by a grand banquet and large photo op. Great support for Suisei comes from pro-monarchist French parties and various minor aristocrats from across Europe."

 global_holo.8.t: "Conservatism in France"
 global_holo.8.desc: "Today Hoshimachi Suisei announced that the government of Suisei France will remain right wing in accordance with the status quo.

 global_holo.8.a: "A surprise victory for the incumbants"

 global_holo.9.t: "Nationalists in France"
 global_holo.9.desc: "Today Hoshimachi Suisei announced that the government of Suisei France will reshape itself into a state with strong nationalist characteristics. The national government of Suisei has decided to remain rightleaning. The new government has a focus on Idol nationalism with a more authoritarian structure, closer to the line of Yagooist thought over Resistance Idol nationalism. This decision comes with great support from certain French nationalist groups and pro-Idol Suiseists. Though the government is approved by the LHS, pro-Yagooists remain wary of its authoritarian elements."
 global_holo.9.a: "A clear pivot towards the Resistance though"

 global_holo.10.t: "Resistance Coalition in France"
 global_holo.10.desc: "Suisei's government has announced a new coalition of pro-Resistance parties that have now taken centre stage in Suisei politics. Suisei herself has made a shift from her pro-LHS stance to being closer to the Resistance, seeing it as a necessity for herself and France. Pro-Resistance elements in Suisei's territories have praised the new political coalition, while many diehard Yagooists condemned the coalition, stating that Suisei has made a great mistake and France is heading towards a grim direction."

 global_holo.11.t: "Yagooist Coalition in France"
 global_holo.11.desc: "Suisei's government has announced a new coalition of pro-Yagooist parties that have now taken centre stage in Suisei politics.

 global_holo.12.t: "End of the East Asian Mandate"
 global_holo.12.desc: "Yagoo's grip on the world continues to be tenuous, especially with so much to control overseas. Asia in particular is a vast landmass with numerous holdings that Yagoo and the LHS directly manage across the land and sea. The Chinese holdings of Zhejiang province, Shanghai, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Port Arthur, Tianjin, Hong Kong, and Guangzhouwan are a series of port and industrial cities that Yagoo directly controls in China, known as the East Asia Mandate. These coastal cities maintain LHS control of the vast coastline of China, and the administration of these territories remains difficult.\n\nUnder much pressure from Gawr Gura, Yagoo has decided to cede the East Asia Mandate to her in order to both placate Gura's loyalty to the LHS and alleviate global administrative pressure. The territories will now formally be part of Gura's controlled territory in China, adding to the size of her nation and boosting her economic progress further. Gura has also gained some national prestige from the Chinese people by reacquiring the lands, albeit at the protest from members of the former Hololive China council. This decision has also elevated the legitimacy of Gura's government as the most legitimate Chinese state."
 global_holo.12.a: "Chinese reunification is now underway"

 global_holo.13.desc: "Yagoo's grip on the world continues to be tenuous, especially with so much to control overseas.

The Chinese holdings of Zhejiang province, Shanghai, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Port Arthur, Tianjin, Hong Kong, and Guangzhouwan are a series of port and industrial cities that Yagoo directly controls in China, known as the LHS China holdings. These coastal cities maintain LHS control of the vast coastline of China, and the administration of these territories remains difficult.\n\nUnder much pressure from Gawr Gura and other political elements from China, Yagoo has ceded these territories to Gura under the condition that they retain a separate democratic constitution. The agreement ensures that Yagooist ideas and influence can still seep into China as long as their autonomy is not eroded."
 global_holo.13.a: "One country, two systems"

 global_holo.14.t: "Gura Remains a Republican"
 global_holo.14.desc: "Gawr Gura and the Atlantean Republic of China has recently announced that they will be reaffirming their commitments to republicanism in China, with Gura remaining as elected president and the Guramintang party in power. The Atlantean Republic takes elements of both Yagooist republicanism and Sun Yat-Sen's Sanmin Principles, uniting both pro-LHS members of Gura's clique and former Kuomintang. The question of whether the Atlantean Republic will transition into full democracy or maintain its status as a republic under Gawr Gura's tutelage is currently up for debate."
 global_holo.14.a: "Republicanism is here to stay in China"

 global_holo.15.t: "Gura Pivots Towards Cocoism"
 global_holo.15.desc: "Gawr Gura and the Atlantean Republic of China has recently announced that she and the Guramintang are now adherents to the Resistance charter of Cocoism. The Atlantean Republic will now focus on Idol nationalism with Gawr Gura herself taking center stage in the governance and leadership of an oligarchy that will control the day to day governance of the country. The Atlantean Republic will also now shift to corporatist economics where the state will manage a large portion of the country's industry and economy. The dramatic political shift has alienated Gawr Gura from the rest of the LHS and all funding towards China from Yagoo has ceased. Meanwhile, Resistance leader Coco recognizes and congratulates Gura for accepting the doctrine of Cocoism. Aqua, while pleased to see a new member of the Resistance is wary of Gura following in the footsteps of Coco. Only time will tell if Gura will be following along with what the Dragon of America has planned or walking down her own path."

 global_holo.16.t: "Gura Claims the Throne"
 global_holo.16.desc: "Gawr Gura and the newly formed Empire of Atlantis has recently announced the dissolution of the republican system and the establishment of a new Chinese dynasty. Gawr Gura has been crowned the new Empress of China to the surprise of both domestic Chinese and the international community. Gura was crowned in traditional Confucian rites in a lavish ceremony in Nanjing. The creation of the Atlantean Dynasty marks a return of China's imperial system, ending republican dominance of Chinese politics in a little over two decades. The new dynasty has brought great shock to the LHS as the republican principles of Yagooism are now thrown the wayside, yet the LHS still wishes to maintain cordial relations to the new dynasty. It appears now that the future of Gura's China is a return to the past."
 global_holo.16.a: "Republicanism didn't last very long now did it"

 global_holo.17.t: "Gura Targets the HoloCNs"
 global_holo.17.desc: "Gawr Gura has announced the start of a new campaign for the subjugation of the former Hololive China Council members. The members sit along the borders of Gawr Gura, accepting Gura's legitimacy as the central Chinese government in name only, while in reality managing their personal warlord fiefdoms, waiting for an opportunity to strike.\n\nGura has decided to take the initiative, demanding all Hololive China Council members to surrender and be integrated into Atlantis or else military force will be used. The question of whether the HoloCNs will submit or resist is still in the air."

 global_holo.18.t: "Bae Seizes Power"
 global_holo.18.desc: "After a brief civil war between pro-Baelz generals and anti forces in Colombia, Baelz has managed to come out on top and stands victorious. Upon seizing power, her opponents were trialled and arrested for treason and insurrection against the state. Baelz, riding the storm of victory, has then formed a  loyalist military junta to lock down control of the country, securing her grasp over Colombia. As such, due to Baelz's pro-Yagooist stance the LHS can rest easy knowing they have secured another pro-LHS state in South America."

 global_holo.19.t: "The Iroha Revolution"
 global_holo.19.desc: "Gunfire rings across the Japanese countryside and the urban centers of Japan are set ablaze as the Iroha Revolution is now in full swing. Kazama Iroha, a honorbound ascetic samurai and prominent member of Japan's intelligence services has been gaining influence in Japanese politics in recent years, particularly with the pro-Imperial Kodoha Faction of the Imperial Japanese Army that seeks to remove democracy from Japan to restore the Emperor's almighty imperial powers. Iroha's hands in the faction has naturally led to a pro-Hololive stance and they have just launched an armed uprising against the current ruling Japanese government. Northern Japan and the outskirts of Tokyo have been seized by the Kodoha Faction and now seek to march on Tokyo itself and eventually the rest of Japan. The outcome of this revolution is still up in the air, but knowing the fanatical and bloodthirsty nature of the Japanese military, this will be a bloody war."

 global_holo.26.desc: "At the onset of Mano Aloe's victory in her civil war, the government remained in military control until the reconstruction of Hungary was completed and made promises to restore full democracy to the nation.

 global_holo.27.t: "Aloe Seizes Power"
 global_holo.27.desc: "As Aloe came out on top in her civil war, she quickly took the opportunity to seize power previously unobtainable before the conflict. To ensure no further conflicts happen in the future and to deter all possible forms of anti organisation, Aloe has arrested and detained numerous members of the anti-uprising in Hungary and arrested hundreds more linked to the antis, and possibly thousands presumably related to those who fought for the antis. Martial law has continued in Aloe Hungary and will not end until every last root and remnant of anti-Aloe sentiment has been quashed and every person in Hungary recognizes Aloe as the sole holder of power in the country."

 global_holo.30.desc: "Due to the ongoing Easter Crisis that is plaguing the Kingdom of Watson, Amelia Watson and the Teammates have pushed through the Westminster Constitution, which in turn means the continued support of LHS style democracy at the expense of centuries old English tradition.

 global_holo.31.desc: "In a sudden turn of events, the  Teammates Front coalition that has ruled Britain since the end of the Great War has collapsed. Many have speculated that the failure of the party's economic recovery plan and the fallout of the Easter Crisis pushed the already strained coalition to its limits.

In the agreement, all parties agreed that the de facto territories controlled by the respective states would be made the official borders and that materials, prisoners and treasury be split up.
