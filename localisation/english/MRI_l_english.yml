MRI_mori_calliope: "Mori Calliope"
MRI_mori_calliope_desc: "Mori Calliope became the de facto leader of the Western United States after the Hololive Revolt. Setting up a far more progressive pro Yagoo state bringing programs such as food distribution and free healthcare and became part of the LHS in 1928.. Due to her nation being part of the LHS The Resistance a rival faction to the LHS became openly hostile towards Mori Calliope.\n\nThe New Callifornia Republic has many internal problems despite Calli trying to fix said problems with little progress. The biggest problem being armed forces which have always been outdated. The army has always focused on trench warfare, never needing to keep her army to the standards of other modern armies due to Calli herself thinking war between The New Callifornia Republic and any other state was unlikely.\n\nHowever tensions between The Ookami Federation and Coconfederate States, both of which want unification of America, have hit a boiling point and war seems inevitable between the two states. Calli now fears her state will be dragged into the war between The Ookami Federation and Coconfederate states or more likely the victor of the upcoming war between The Ookami Federation and Coconfederate States will come after The New Callifornia Republic next seeing how The New Callifornia Republicwould be the next step to reunification."
