SHI_murasaki_shion: "Murasaki Shion"
SHI_murasaki_shion_desc: "Shion worked her way up the ranks from being a simple camp cook to General Secretary of the Chilean Socialist Workers Party. After realising what having a real job entailed, Shion felt agitated that workers such as herself were subjected to such difficult working conditions. She through her fellow nitrate workers found herself at numerous trade union meetings where she became a dedicated member of the cause. In 1912 using the precedent of the Hololive Revolution to bolster her revolutionary cause Shion became one of the key founders of the POS (Partido Obrero Socialista). Her popularity soon skyrocketed and she became General Secretary of the party. From her position of power she successfully radicalised the party and in 1915 rebranded it to the (PCC) Partido Comunista de Chile. The Chilean government was far from being passive though, and attempted to crush the party on numerous occasions. That same year, the party formed a broad alliance between the trade unions, the left wing section of the Democratic Party and Indigenous particularists to launch a revolt against the Chilean government. In 1917, the government in Santiago capitulated and a new socialist government was installed in the country.\n\nFollowing the revolution's success, the country was immediately faced with economic hardship as synthetic fertilizers became more competitive and put the nitrate industry in Chile under stress. Nevertheless Shion was re-elected as General Secretary and began enacting various social, political and economic reforms. However, Shion's hardline stance on all matters alienated much of the coalition she worked with during the Civil War. This tension in the coalition boiled over when an attempt was made on Shion's life in 1933. Shion's faction was not powerful or popular enough to use this opportunity to enact a purge but suspicion was immediately placed on the social democrats within the party. Now, having to deal with party infighting, economic chaos, waning popularity and a military that had fallen behind Aqua's Brazil and Ayame's Argentina, Shion has a tenuous future ahead of her."
