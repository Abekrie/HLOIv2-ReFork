arab.1.t: "The Winds of Change"
arab.1.d: "Word has passed of yet another push for modernization in our country. Although most are indifferent to this change, many have gathered to protest the slew of changes that have occured since the coming of the Hololivers. On a street corner an Immam boldly shouts out to a crowd:\n\n 'Why must we adopt the ways of infidels? Why must we change our way of life to fit that of our enemies? Our leaders made us slaves to Constantinople! They sold our country for worthless baubles! And most importantly they have abandoned the word of the prophet, for that they will truly perish in the eternal hellfires.'"

arab.1.b: "The old order must be defended!"

arab.2.d: "On a neatly paved road, men brazenly walk about in their imported suits on their way to clerical jobs. In some areas women have even ditched their traditional headscarfs while on their usual shopping trips. Life is almost alien to that a few years ago as the standard living has improved, but yet a feeling of emptiness still remains. A feeling that despite the newly found luxuries, there is still a void that must be filled."

They wish to restore local rule and reinstate traditional values to the Arabian Peninsula. However, there are many local rulers who agree with Korone's methods of industrialization to push the Arab states into the future, and they will side with her. We must choose where we stand in this conflict."
arab.3.a: "We must defend the old order!"
arab.3.b: "Long live the revolution!"

arab.4.t: "The Arab Revolution"
arab.4.d: "Due to the centralized meddling and pro-LHS, pro-Westernization methods of Inugami Korone, the local citizens of our nation have risen up against Korone, calling her a “Dog of the West”. They wish to restore local rule and reinstate traditional values to the Arabian Peninsula. Country. However, there are many other citizens who agree with Korone's methods of industrialization to push Arabia into the future, and they will side with her. There is currently a coup by anti-Korone militia in our country and we must make a decision on whether or not we accept Korone or should fight against her."
arab.4.a: "We must defend the old order!"
arab.4.b: "Long live the revolution!"

arab.5.t: "The Palestine Revolt"
arab.5.d: "In Yagoo controlled Palestine, the fervor of revolution has hit and locals have begun assaulting pro-LHS officials while raiding LHS police stations. It seems like the Arab Revolution is in full swing now and we need to decide if we should let the region go or try to maintain control."
arab.5.a: "Crush them"
arab.5.b: "We'll deal with them later"

arab.6.t: "Revolts in Syria and Iraq"
arab.6.d: "In Syria and Iraq, the Arab Revolution has spread and local militias have begun organizing armed resistance against Korone's loyalists. There is heavy fighting in Baghdad and Aleppo as both forces clash. We must choose if it is worth it keeping Syria and Iraq under our control or let them go for now."
arab.6.a: "Crush them"
arab.6.b: "We'll deal with them later"

arab.7.t: "Demonstrations in Cairo"
arab.7.d: "In Egypt, the Arab Revolution is beginning to take form and local militias have been taking the initiative by attacking LHS garrisons in Cairo and along the Nile River. To make our advance easier we could take the time to negotiate with the local rulers."
arab.7.a: "The Constitution stays"
arab.7.b: "The Constitution goes"

arab.8.t: "Join the Jihad?"
arab.8.d: "Sudan is currently under the thumb of the Mad Rabbit Usada Pekora. They are still our brothers, so perhaps we should make the effort to liberate them too?"

arab.8.b: "Finally, let's destroy this infidel rabbit!"

arab.9.t: "Demonstrations in the Capital"
