arab.1.t: "The Winds of Change"
arab.1.d: "Word has passed of yet another push for modernization in our country. Although most are indifferent to this change, many have gathered to protest the slew of changes that have occured since the coming of the Hololivers. On a street corner an Immam boldly shouts out to a crowd:\n\n 'Why must we adopt the ways of infidels? Why must we change our way of life to fit that of our enemies? Our leaders made us slaves to Constantinople! They sold our country for worthless baubles! And most importantly they have abandoned the word of the prophet, for that they will truly perish in the eternal hellfires.'"

In some areas women have even ditched their traditional headscarfs while on their usual shopping trips. Life is almost alien to that a few years ago as the standard living has improved, but yet a feeling of emptiness still remains. A feeling that despite the newly found luxuries, there is still a void that must be filled."
