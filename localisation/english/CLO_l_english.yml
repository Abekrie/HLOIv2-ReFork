CLO_sakamata_chloe_desc: "Sakamata Chloe is the military governor of the North Philippines, currently under the protectorship of Gawr Gura. She is an agent of the secret HoloX society, an organization that seeks world domination.\n\nChloe first went undercover for HoloX in the US living as a Catholic nun to gain insider knowledge. She was then sent to a mission in the Philippines where she also took the opportunity to gather intel. At the outbreak of the Hololive Revolution, she utilized her connections in the Church to incite a local rebellion that ousted American troops and the Philippine government. As she struggled to maintain her new grasp of power, she was invaded by Haachama who seized half of the Philippine islands in the South, stopped only by LHS intervention via Gura. Gura then took Chloe under her wing for protection to stop the expansion of Haachama.\n\nIn her current situation, Chloe must quickly build defenses against the mounting Haaton threat, as the border clashes grow more intense and the threat of a second invasion is becoming more possible by the day. In addition, Chloe needs to develop a strong, independent holding to help further the HoloX cause of global domination."
