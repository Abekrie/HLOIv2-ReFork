gura.14.t: "No Clues Found"
gura.14.desc: "Despite the best efforts of our investigators, no clues about the alleged He Yinqing plot have been found. Perhaps, he really is innocent and we should let itgo to try our luck elsewhere. Hopefully this would not lead to any drastic consequences"
gura.14.a: "Damn"

gura.15.t: "A Suspect Found!"
gura.15.desc: "After a delicate search, we managed to find someone related to the He Yinqing Plot. We should follow this lead and take action. The suspect will likely try to leave the nation so it's now or never."

gura.18.a: "How could we lose such a man..."

gura.19.t: "A Question ofgovernance"
gura.19.desc: "To run our Empire effectively we need a new and competent Prime Minister. We need to choose someone who will help lead ourgovernment."
gura.19.a: "Xu Shichang is such a smartguy!"
gura.19.b: "Chen Kuilong is such a wiseguy!"
gura.19.c: "Tang Shaoli is such a progressiveguy!"

gura.20.t: "Xu Shichang's Constitution"
gura.20.desc: "Within a meeting room in the halls of parliament, agroup of various ministers met withgura to discuss the future of theirgovernment. Among them the conservative leader, Xu Shichang has proposed the adoption of a new constitution. His idea, named “Qing monarchy with constitutional restraints” states for the creation of a constitutional monarchy, with a Qing Emperor or Empress as its central figurehead. This proposal was met with severe backlash from most of the men in the room who stated that monarchy has brought nothing but hardship to China during its vast history, and that the way forward was a true democracy. The decision however was ultimately left togura on how she wished togovern her nation"
gura.20.a: "Replace “empress” with “president” and you have a deal."
gura.20.b: "I'd like to be the empress"

gura.21.t: "Who Shall be the President?"
gura.21.desc: "With Xu Shichang's constitution being rewritten at the behest ofgura and the other ministers, one question remains. Who should become the president to lead this nation to a brighter future?”"
gura.21.a: "That'd be me!"

gura.22.t: "Xu Shichang Accepts the Ammendment"
gura.22.desc: "Having heard Xu Shichang's proposed constitution,gura would propose that she be made the new Chinese monarch, much to the surprise of the other men in the room. But nevertheless Xu Shichang acceptedgura's request"
gura.22.a: "I am now Empress of all China!"

gura.23.t: "Xu Shichang Rejects the Ammendment"
gura.23.desc: "Much togura's outrage, Xu Shichang rejectedgura's demand to be made China's reigning monarch. As a result, she would reject Xu Shichang's proposed constitution, instead opting to find someone else to write a better one."
gura.23.a: "Fine, I'll justgo to Chen Kuliong!"
gura.23.b: "Fine, I'll justgo to Tang Shaoli"
gura.23.c: "Who even needs theseguys anyways?!"

gura.24.t: "An Attempt ongura's Life!"
gura.24.desc: "With Xu Shichang's constitution being rejected,gura instead chose to work with the more die-hard monarchist Chen Kuliong. This raised alarm bells among numerous high ranking ministers, especially the still embittered Xu Shichang. A few days later, asgura and Kuliong met at her residence to discuss implementing his constitution, two men would storm the building with the intent of killing the two. Thankfully they would be subdued before they could cause any more harm. After lengthy interrogation, one of the assassins broke and revealed shocking details. They were members of the New Xinzhonghui entrusted by Xu Shichang who ordered them to assassinategura and Kuliong, fearing they would forcibly restore an absolute monarch. Not only had a radicalgroup made an attempt ongura's life, but it seemed that one of the nation's most capable politicians had been swayed to their side."
gura.24.a: "It seems I have no choice."

gura.25.t: "Blackmail!"
gura.25.desc: "Followinggura's decision to adopt Tang Shaoli's constitution, he would visitgura at her residence. As both of them drank tea and made small talk, Shaoli changed the conversation as he revealed something he knew. He revealed to her that he knew her true ambitions. To declare herself as Empress of China, the complete opposite of his republican and democratic beliefs. He threatened to reveal thisgoal to not just her cabinet, but to the whole nation as well. However, he also stated that he would forget this encounter and keep this secret under one condition. That he begiven further powers as the new Prime Minister."
gura.25.a: "Hell no!"

gura.26.t: "Chen Kuilong's Constitution"
gura.26.desc: "Chen Kuilong approachedguraoff ruling the nation as an absolute monarchy, like the old Qing emperors. However, to agree to this would underminegura's founding principles of democracy with his ideas of monarchy restoration. He assured the sharkgirl that such a transformation would not only strengthen the state, by centralising all of authority in the hands of one person, but also wouldget her the Mandate of Heaven and ability to unite all of China under her banner. And with her popularity among the citizens andglory from the past victories, she would certainly make an excellent empress.\n\nGura admitted that becoming an absolute monarch was a tempting offer, but she also knew that such a radical political manoeuvre might destroy her nation. With republicans holding a majority in thegovernment and warlords seeking for any sign of instability to proclaim independence - perhaps she should compromise and hold back her ambitions by creating a constitutional monarchy, to pacify the opposition."
gura.26.a: "Make it a constitutional monarchy and we have a deal"
gura.26.b: "I agree to all of it"

gura.27.t: "Treason!?"
gura.27.desc: "Chinese pro-republicans were always sceptical towardsgura, suspecting that she wasgoing to usurp all of the state power for herself. So when the rumours about her plans to restore the monarchy in China reached them - republicans weren't surprised and prepared to take action. During an annualgovernment meeting they confrontedgura, accusing her of treason to the state and threatening to arrest her if she does not abandon her monarchist leanings."
gura.27.a: "You misheard, I support the republic!"
gura.27.b: "*POW* *POW* *POW*"

gura.28.t: "Tang Shaoli's Constitution"
gura.28.desc: "Gura's next candidate was the reformer, Tang Shaoli. His proposal stated that China should adhere to Hololive principles and become a republic. Elected president shall be an official head of the state, sharing the power with his cabinet and parliament. Each Chinese citizen would be entitled to freedom of speech, freedom of expression, access to fair working conditions and that companies must adhere to strict labour laws to protect their workers from harm and abuse."
gura.28.a: "Accept, this is fine for me"
gura.28.b: "Uhhh, I'llgo by someone else"

gura.29.t: "Encounter with the New-Xinzhonghui"
gura.29.desc: "Tang had expectedgura to reject his proposed constitution. As a result, he shouted 'For the Republic! Death to Tyrants!', prompting armed men from the New Xinzhonghui to emerge from windows within the house or behind shrubs. As they trained theirguns ongura, she and herguards took cover behind a flipped over table as they took aim at them. Tang Shaoli made his intentions clear. Ifgura does not accept his proposal, then she will die at the hands of the New Xinzhonghui."
gura.29.a: "Uhh yeah of course I support him"
gura.29.b: "*POW* *POW* *POW*"

gura.30.t: "Dawn of the Atlantean Dynasty"
gura.30.desc: "After countless backroom deals, political manoeuvring, internal division and hardship,gura is finally set to secure her vision of China once and for all. To establish her new dynasty that will unite all of China and spread prosperity, equality, progress and harmony across the entire empire. Under the newly proclaimed Atlantean Dynasty, this new Chinese Empire shall bring China to a new era."
gura.30.a: "'I am ready'"

gura.31.t: "Riots in Nanjing!"
gura.31.desc: "Over the radio,gura announced the formation of her Atlantean Dynasty, not just to the citizens of Nanjing, but to across China and the world. However, reception to the proclamation was not as positive asgura had hoped. Immediately following it, riots broke out in the streets as people, mainly young students, scholars and others protested what they saw as the return of the flawed Chinese monarchist system. To make matters worse,gura received a letter from Yagoo, stating his disapproval regarding her most recent decision."
gura.31.a: "Woops"

gura.32.t: "A Sigh of Relief"
gura.32.desc: "Following the countless political intrigue between various high ranking ministers,gura decided to address not just her cabinet, but also the entire nation. Over the radio,gura would address everything from the rumours regarding her behind the scenes politics, to the attempt on her life at the hands of the New Xinzhonghui. To the relief of many,gura would reaffirm her stance of maintaining democracy, standing by her pledge to defending the republic."
gura.32.a: "Long Live the Republic!"

gura.33.t: "A Sigh of Relief"
gura.33.desc: "Despite being unpopular among other ministers,gura had favoured Xu Shichang's proposed constitution, as it combined her dream as Empress of China with the principles of democracy that had helped bring her nation into the modern era. After several days of talks behind the scenes,gura would make a proclamation that rang across China and the world. The adoption of Xu Shichang's 'Qing Monarchy with Constitutional Restraints' system, proclaiming herself Empress of China while stating her intent to maintain an elected parliament, under a newly written constitution."
gura.33.a: "The Atlantean Dynasty has risen."

gura.34.t: "A Question of Antis?"
gura.34.desc: "There are some in this country that still have doubts on whether a country ruled by a Hololiver can still work. In the past we have ostracised them from our political system, but if we really are to establish democracy, maybe we could invite them in for somegoodwill?"
gura.34.a: "They'll behave if they're in thegovernment"
gura.34.b: "Evidently this system has failed"

gura.35.t: "A Question of the HoloCNs?"
gura.35.desc: "A question has arisen over the fate of those loyal to the HoloCNs. While they are Hololivers, relations with our state has not been thegreatest. Despite this, we could attempt reconciliation with them should we allow them to become part of our nascent democracy."
gura.35.a: "They'll behave if integrated"
gura.35.b: "Evidently this system has failed"

gura.36.t: "Role ofgura?"
gura.36.desc: "Whilegura herself had been fairly supportive of our ongoing democratic reforms, she has expressed various misgivings regarding the scale of the reforms that are being made. She is worried that by allowing forgreater voices to everyone, antis or former HoloCNs could jeopardise the stability of the state by opening up the country to subversive forces.given these concerns, should we continue our efforts at instituting the Mio Model?"
gura.36.a: "Respect the principles of the Hololive Republic"
gura.36.b: "Evidently this system has failed"

gura.37.t: "Future of theguramintang"
gura.37.desc: "Thegura Nationalist Party, made up of many ardent supporters of the current regime, has found it necessary to transition to allow more elements of democracy in its ranks. As our democratic reforms continue, its new advocacy for democracy is therefore fundamental to ensuring these reforms succeed. Can they convince the other disparate factions of both the party and the nation to work together for a better society?"
gura.37.a: "Theguramintang crushes the competition!"
gura.37.b: "Theguramintang crashes in the polls!"
gura.37.c: "We need to compromise, ally with the nationalists"
gura.37.d: "We need to compromise, ally with the Progressives"

gura.38.t: "Failure of Mio Democracy"
gura.38.desc: "Unfortunately democracy does not seem suited for the course of our nation. Despite our best efforts, ultimately the democratic experiment had not captured both popular andgovernmental interests."
gura.38.a: "Damn"

gura.39.t: "Moderate success of Mio Democracy"
gura.39.desc: "It wasn't easy, but we have managed to firmlyget our country on the track for democratic success. While there are still various issues with integrating the disparate political factions into our new democracy, with time thesegrowing pains would surelygive way to a fully-functioning stable country."
gura.39.a: "Better than nothing I suppose"

gura.40.t: "REPLACE_ME"
gura.40.desc: "We have surpassed even the dreams of the biggest democratic idealist here. With the unparalleled success of the Mio Model, we have proven that it is possible to reconcile our political foes in pursuit of common peace for all."
gura.40.a: "Bring out the champagne!" 

gura.41.t: "The Council of Corporations"
gura.41.desc: "A new day dawns, as we have rid ourselves of the old and corrupt parliament. In its place we shall have a new parliament, composed of the most loyal party members, powerful industrialists and representatives from the largest trade unions across the country. With them bygura's side, she will lead this country to its well deservedglory."
gura.41.a: "Truly a new day for China!"

gura.42.t: "Collectivisation and Conglomeration"
gura.42.desc: "Reforming our economic system is the first step into a more prosperous future. We have two economic systems to choose from, both with their own benefits and flaws. A free capitalist system, or collectivisation, where the state owns the means of production"
gura.42.a: "Let the free market be"
gura.42.b: "Everything under the state"

gura.43.t: "Han Supremacy"
gura.43.desc: "The Han Chinese people make up a majority of our population. But even then, China consists of many peoples, each with unique traditions, faiths and languages. In an ever changing world we must decide the policy regarding China's majority. While it would be a progressive move to support China's many ethnicgroups, the council is more in favour of maintaining the supremacy of the Han people."
gura.43.a: "Is this even a question?"
gura.43.b: "One China, many nations"

gura.44.t: "Industrialization vs Ruralisation"
gura.44.desc: "Historically China has always been a rural nation. Our farm lands are world renown, feeding millions at home and abroad with the best crops our fertile land and hard working peasants can offer. But will this last forever? As our council is made of numerous industrialists, many are in favour of focusing our efforts on expanding industrialization. But equally important is supporting our peasants and the development of our rapidly expanding cities, lest we run the risk of a communist uprising from the rapid industrialization and mass displacement of labour."
gura.44.a: "We are a nation of peasants"
gura.44.b: "The proletariat are a hotbed of revolution, a balance is needed"
gura.44.c: "We need to develop our cities"

gura.45.t: "Centralization vs Decentralization"
gura.45.desc: "China is a vast nation, with every corner of this nation filled with different people who have distinct traditions, faiths and languages, residing in lands that look foreign to the average citizen within Inner China. Historically, past dynasties have relied on localgovernors and warlords to maintain control over these vast regions. However the Council proposed thatgovernance over China be more centralised to better manage the resources and populations of these provinces. Such an effort would be beneficial, but would also take time and may cause outrage among more autonomous populations."
gura.45.a: "Everything in the state"
gura.45.b: "Localgovernors know best"

gura.46.t: "Foreign Assets"
gura.46.desc: "For the past hundred years, foreign companies have operated on Chinese soil. While they bring revenue and jobs for our people, some also exploit our people with harsh working conditions and small wages. They are also ofgreat concern to the industrialists that are in our Council, as they are afraid these foreign industries will outperform and overtake their businesses. For these reasons, much of the council is in favour of nationalising these foreign assets. But such a drastic decision may come with consequences, both economically and diplomatically."
gura.46.a: "Nationalise them but sell them off"
gura.46.b: "Nationalise and keep them"
gura.46.c: "“Leave them alone"

gura.47.t: "View of Antis"
gura.47.desc: "The unfortunate reality is that some people are not willing to accept thegood thatgura has done for the nation. Some are so extreme that they will do whatever it takes to resist the influence ofgura and those who support her. Whilegura is willing to leave these people alone, the Council sees them as a threat to China's stability and as such they call for them to be branded as traitors."
gura.47.a: "Leave them alone"
gura.47.b: "Hang the dogs"

gura.48.t: "Foreign Policy"
gura.48.desc: "Having consolidated ourgovernment and economy, the time has come to look out onto the world stage. Some in the council advocate for isolationism, focusing our efforts inwards to help our people, especially our Han citizens. Others say we should reunite all of China under our banner, reclaiming the old borders of the Qing empire while others say we shouldgo further, claiming more territory togain more territory and resources."
gura.48.a: "Our priority is the Han people"
gura.48.b: "We should return to the borders of the Qing..."
gura.48.c: "...or we couldgo beyond that"

gura.49.t: "Fate of the Unions"
gura.49.desc: "With mass industrialization came many benefits but also downsides. Low wages, long hours and horrific working conditions as well as many others. As a result, numerous labour unions arose togive the workers representation. However, so many different unions not supervised by the state can lead to the spread of ideas harmful to the state. The Council has suggested that we reorganise the unions into more manageable and state owned ones, while some suggest shutting them down altogether."
gura.49.a: "Leave them alone"
gura.49.b: "Consolidate the unions"
gura.49.c: "Crush them"

gura.50.t: "The Blue Shirts"
gura.50.desc: "The upheaval and turmoil leading up to the Council's formation has shown that even a 'stable' country is vulnerable to the ambitions of the treacherous. As such, a number of Council members have proposed the creation of a paramilitary force loyal solely to the Council andgura, similar to the Usagi Loyalist Front in Italy. Named the Blue Shirts, they will be tasked withguarding Council members, cracking down on any dissent, and fighting alongside the regular army on the frontlines."
gura.50.a: "Why not?"
gura.50.b: "We are a nation of workers, not thugs"

gura.51.t: "Spending Policy"
gura.51.desc: "Recently, Council members have come to us for a change in how we conduct our economic policy. They assert that, as the market is inherently volatile especially in these changing times, one must call for moregovernment intervention through vigorous spending to ensure that our economy remains stable. While these ideas have attracted support among a wide faction of the Council, some still see this as an infringement of the rights of the free market."
gura.51.a: "Keynes' ideas are pretty nifty"
gura.51.b: "What!? We need to balance our books"

gura.52.t: "Conclusion of the Council"
gura.52.desc: "The current session of thegrand Council of Corporations has concluded. The particular session was particularly consequential as it determined the extent of reform that thegovernment intended to pursue. When all was said in done, it was determined that what the nation needed was…"
gura.52.a: "a cultural revolution!"
gura.52.b: "an assurance of the status-quo"

gura.53.t: "Cult of the Shark"
gura.53.desc: "It took many months, butgawrgura has finally taken a commanding position in China. The Atlantean dynasty, now unchallenged, has successfully navigated through these times of troubles, and now has captured the mandate of the heavens. The attempts by the Council to usurp her authority has failed. Together, our sovereigngawrgura, the saviour of the Chinese people, will build a new China that all will admire!"
gura.53.a: "Withoutgura there would be no China!"

gura.54.t: "Supremacy of the Council"
gura.54.desc: "Having consolidated its power, the Council of Corporations has finally secured enough influence to be the sole ruling authority within the empire. No longer willgura have togovern all of China herself, as she has a strong council behind her back."
gura.54.a: "ShAAark!"

gura.55.t: "Political deadlock"
gura.55.desc: "Despite their efforts, neither the Council norgura have been able to surpass one or the other for political influence. As a result, thegovernment has been completely deadlocked, with neither side being able to make a decision or pass a bill into law."
gura.55.a: "That's not what we intended"

#gura.56.t: "REPLACE_ME"
#gura.56.desc: "Placeholder"
#gura.56.a: "REPLACE_ME"

gura.57.t: "A New Republic"
gura.57.desc: "With its new position secured, the Council of Corporations has set about to shape China to fit its model ofgovernance. Inspired by Kiryu Coco and Usagi Pekora, important industries have been nationalised, orgiven to loyal industrialists in the Council, replacing the capitalist economy with a corporatist system. Having rid China of petty democratic opposition and infighting, the Council has directed all resources to achieving itsgoal. Turning the nation into an industrial and military powerhouse to unify all of China."
gura.57.a: "Nothing outside the state, nor against the state."

gura.58.t: "Eyes to the World"
gura.58.desc: "With our position in China consolidated, we may once again bring China back to the world stage. As the world degenerates further into conflict with the increasing tensions between the LHS and Resistance, China undergura is in a prime position to bring our own options onto the table."
gura.58.a: "The world is mine!"

gura.59.t: "Agrand Coronation"
gura.59.desc: "The coronation of our Empressgawrgura occurred today. In a departure from previous coronations of Chinese monarchs, however, the occasion has been marked with aglorious ceremony befittinggura's position as Empress. The heavens smile on us as we have its mandate to rule."
gura.59.a: "Truly Magnificent"

gura.60.t: "Draft a Constitution"
gura.60.desc: "There are many factions within the monarchist movement, all with their own model on how the monarchy should be conducted. As our new dynasty prepares to bare its fangs, and a new monarchist constitution established, we must decide once and for all what model we should choose. Leaving some room for democracy should ensure popular unrest be kept to a minimum with their privileges secure, butgura is the newly-ordained Daughter of Heaven after all, with the state as her witness..."
gura.60.a: "Insert same vague notions of democracy"
gura.60.b: "We demand loyalty to the Empress"

gura.61.t: "Republican Elements"
gura.61.desc: "While ruling all of China uncontested sounds like agood idea, past events have proven that taking away too much of the people's freedom will only end in disaster. As such, the adoption of some democratic reforms such as an elected cabinet andgovernors will keep the people calm, lowering the chance of rebellion and allowinggura to rule peacefully."
gura.61.a: "The people shall have rights!"

gura.62.t: "Divine Rule"
gura.62.desc: "Gura has done much for China. From saving it from petty warlords and Japanese imperialism, to turning it into an industrial powerhouse. As such, it is safe to say thatgura has earned the Mandate of Heaven to reign supremely as China's empress. Like thegreat Emperors and Empresses before her,gura shallguide China into a newgolden age, not bound by bureaucratic deadlock or squabbling ministers.gura's words will be obeyed without question and upheld with the utmost loyalty."
gura.62.a: "The Heavens shine brightly ongura."

gura.63.t: "Policy Towards Ina"
gura.63.desc: "To the North of our country lies Manchuria and Korea, under the control of Ina's Tentaculy. While we have maintainedgood relations with Ina during the past few years, many are suspicious of the Tentacult's true ambitions and unpredictability."

gura.63.b: "We need a reliable ally to our North"
gura.63.c: "One crown, one empire"

gura.64.t: "Ina Accepts Integration"
gura.64.desc: "To our delight, Ina has agreed to peacefully integrate the Tentacult and her nation into our empire. While it will take some time to fully annex Manchuria and Korea, so long as Ina can convince them of ourgood intentions, the Takodachis will fully support joining our empire."
gura.64.a: "Welcome to the empire, Ina"

gura.65.t: "Ina Rejects Integration"
gura.65.desc: "Ina has responded to our request for peaceful integration. She has refused, citing that the Tentacult has its owngoals on the world stage. With this in mind, we must decide on what to do with the Tentacult."

gura.65.b: "How fast can we march into Manchuria?"

gura.66.t: "Ina Accepts Our Alliance"

gura.66.a: "A win for mutual security."

gura.67.t: "Ina Rejects Our Alliance"
gura.67.desc: "Ina rejecting our proposed alliance has raised questions within parliament. While some are in favour of leaving Ina alone, others call for us to retake our rightfully claimed territory of Manchuria and to secure our northern borders."
gura.67.a: "Leave them be"
gura.67.b: "How fast can we march into Manchuria?"

gura.68.t: "Policy towards HoloCNs"
gura.68.desc: "The HoloCNs are in an interesting position for us. They did arrive in this world along with the rest of the Hololivers, but they have largelygrown estranged from the Hololiver world order, instead degenerating into various warlord factions. With thegeopolitical situation rapidly shifting though, we need a united China more than ever.  Should we negotiate with the HoloCNs to try andget them to see reason?"
gura.68.a: "We should integrate them, we need a united front"
gura.68.b: "The HoloCN Federation from this day, is dead"

gura.69.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses to Submit!"
gura.69.desc: "Unfortunately for [FROM.GetName], they have refused to see reason. Instead of accepting one united China undergura's command, they have instead let their own pride and ego cloud their judgements. In the face of such insolence, the only response we must do is to proceed with unification forcefully to ensure the survival of China."
gura.69.a: "War is the only option then"

gura.70.t: "Disaster in Nanking"
gura.70.desc: "A major protest against our rule is taking place in Nanjing. While this is normally something we could stamp out, this particular protest has become a challenge to put down due to the sheer scale of the protest. As our legitimacy suffers, antis and opportunists will most definitely use these demonstrations for their own ends and already the state that we have worked so hard to build is beginning to tumble down."
gura.70.a: "Uh oh"

gura.71.t: "Doris Folds!"
gura.71.desc: "Wonderous news from the province of Shandong, as Doris has agreed to be incorporated within our empire. This annexation has not justgiven us access to Doris' resources but is also one more step before full control of the Yellow Sea."
gura.71.a: "Shandong is ours again!"

gura.72.t: "Yogiri Folds!"
gura.72.desc: "A message from Taiyuan has arrived. To our delight, it stated Yogiri's intentions to hand over her territory over to us. After years of division, the mountains of Shanxi and Shaanxi are under the fold of the Chinese Empire once again"

gura.73.desc: "Rosalyn's reign overguangdong has come to an end, following her acceptance of handing over the territory over togura's empire.guangdong's resources and people will prove useful, as well as the portsgiving us easier access to the South China Sea"
gura.73.a: "Once more we rule Canton!"

gura.74.t: "Aria Folds!"
gura.74.desc: "To our delighted surprise, Artia has agreed to become a vassal of our Empire. We always expected Artia to put up more of a fight, to the point where we had planned for fighting to break out. But it seems Artia was much more practical than we initially thought."
gura.74.a: "“A victory for diplomacy."

gura.75.t: "Civia Folds!"
gura.75.desc: "From the ancient city of Chongqing, we have received word that Civia has agreed to surrender the province of Sichuan togura and become a vassal of the Atlantean Empire. Chongqing, the innermost port along the main Yangtze river, is finally ours again."

gura.76.t: "Echo Folds!"
gura.76.desc: "After an arduous time, with negotiations seeminglygoing nowhere, Echo has finally seen our ways and agreed to submit togura's rule. Her resources and influence will prove useful to our empire as we strive forgreatergoals across the world."
gura.76.a: "We have subdued the illusivegangster"

gura.77.t: "Doris Wants Autonomy"
gura.77.desc: "Before the full annexation of Shandong, its ruler Doris made an interesting demand. She asked that she begranted the title of Baroness within our Empire's hierarchy in order to rule Shandong on behalf ofgura."
gura.77.a: "What a ridiculous request"
gura.77.b: "We see no harm in it"

gura.78.t: "Yogiri Wants Democracy"
gura.78.desc: "As negotiations for the incorporation of Shanxi into the Empire went on, Yogiri put forward a request controversial amonggura and her ministers. She demanded that her territory begranted a special democratic system, allowed to electgovernors and representatives."
gura.78.a: "Absolutely not!"
gura.78.b: "Whatever, sure"

gura.79.t: "Rosalyn Wants Corporatism"
gura.79.desc: "Rosalyn's latest request during the integration negotiations was an interesting one. Her request was thatguangdong adopt a special economic system based around Corporatism, where her regionalgovernment and loyal corporations control the territory's resources."
gura.79.a: "This will compromise our economy!"
gura.79.b: "If it benefits the province, so be it."

gura.80.t: "Artia Threatens Us!"
gura.80.desc: "In response to our offer for assimilation, Artia instead stands defiant, stating that she will drive back any attempt of annexation with her Yunnan army. Some of our ministers think that fighting Artia isn't worth the bloodshed, while others think that the only way to make her submit is to show we are more than capable of fighting her."
gura.80.a: "This isn't worth it."
gura.80.b: "Enact a show of force."

gura.81.t: "Civia wants minority rights"
gura.81.desc: "As we prepared to integrate Sichuan, Civia made an important counter-offer. She stated that if we were to annex her province, then we mustgive equal rights and treatment to Sichuan's various minoritygroups. Specifically the Tibetians, Yi, Qiang, and Nakhi people, as well as other ethnic minorities."
gura.81.a: "They shall prosper under our empire"
gura.81.b: "The Han will always be the dominant people."

gura.82.t: "Echo Wants Influence"
gura.82.desc: "The most odd and controversial request we havegotten came from Echo. She requested that she begranted immunity from thegovernment, allowing her to continue her illicit activities unimpeded. She also asked that we appoint ministers who're sympathic to her, as well as divert money to her organisation."
gura.82.a: "This may work in our favour."
gura.82.b: "Working withgangsters? Never!"

gura.83.t: "Our Show of Force Successful!"
gura.83.desc: "Our intimidation of Artia seemed to have paid off. The soldiers of the Imperial army were able to push back and rout the Yunnan border troops, showing that Artia's forces are inferior to our army."
gura.83.a: "It seems that Aria was just a paper tiger"

gura.84.t: "Our Show of Force Failed!"
gura.84.desc: "The attack on the border proved to be a disaster, as we have underestimated the defences along the Yunnan mountains. If anything it has inspired Artia to hold herground. We have no other choice but to mobilise the entire army and fight."
gura.84.a: "We shall match force withgreater force!"

gura.85.t: "Artia Refuses to Submit"
gura.85.desc: "Despite our victory at the border, Artia intends to fight to the bitter end to defend her country. Already we have received reports of more troops from the Yunnan army marching towards their defences in the mountains. If Artia is content with fighting, then we are obliged to meet her in combat"
gura.85.a: "Our troops shall march on Kunming!"

gura.86.t: "Artia Submits"
gura.86.desc: "Seeing the superiority of our soldiers at the border skirmish, Artia seems to have realised that resisting our army will only result in unnecessary bloodshed and destruction. As a result, we have received a message from Artia stating that she intends to submitgura's rule."
gura.86.a: "Once more our flag flies over Yunnan."

gura.87.t: "Splendid Recovery"
gura.87.desc: "Since the collapse of Gura's authority in various regions of the empire, many believed it was only a matter of time before Gura's regime stagnated or even fell. But surprisingly, the country had managed to stabilise and new reforms were introduced within the imperial government to better improve their legitimacy and popular support. With these changes having been implemented, Gura began to focus on regaining control of her territories from the warlords."
gura.87.a: "China is not dead yet!"

gura.88.t: "The Ma Family Integrated"
gura.88.desc: "Ever since the collapse of HoloCN authority, the Ma family clique had sought to solidify their control over the North-western provinces of China; in defiance of Gura's new government. However after Gura stabilised the empire, she demanded that the Ma clique be reintegrated into the empire. After some deliberation, the Ma clique agreed to become subjects of Gura again, so long as the family maintained positions in the regional government."
gura.88.a: "Gansu is ours again!" 

gura.89.t: "The Ma Family Refuses to Integrate"
gura.89.desc: "Ever since the collapse of HoloCN authority, the Ma family clique had sought to solidify their control over the North-western provinces of China; in defiance of Gura's new government.\n\nEven after Gura has solidified her rule, the Ma Family's has refused to kowtow to Nanjing. In our most recent incident with the Ma, they have reaffirmed their independence and have rejected any calls for integration. Such a response should only be met by military force."
gura.89.a: "War it is then"
gura.89.b: "We'll come back later..."

gura.90.t: "Integrating Zhao Hengti's Army"
gura.90.desc: "Zhao Hengti is a veteran of the Xinhai Revolutution and one of the few warlords left in Gura's territory after the collapse of the federal HoloCN government. Since then, Zhao has remained dubiously loyal towards her.\n\nHowever,the Chinese Republic and Guramingtan has grown significantly more authoritarian and even monarchist. This has not gone unnoticed. Zhao and other Xinhai Revolution old guards' allegiance to Nanjing has been wavering since the beginning and word has spread that he may organize a revolt against the central government."
gura.90.a: "Offer him a cabinet role"
gura.90.b: "Demand his submission now"
gura.90.c: "Just request his loyalty"

gura.91.t: "Zhao Hengti Accepts Our Offer"
gura.91.desc: "Zhao Hengti had proven himself to still be an ally of Gura's cause. Not only did he reaffirm his loyalty to Gura and allowed for the reintegration of his territory, but he also accepted an offer by her cabinet to become one of her ministers."
gura.91.a: "One step towards a united China!"

gura.92.t: "Zhao Hengti Refuses Our Offer"
gura.92.desc: "Despite our offer of inclusion into the Cabinet, Zhao Hengti has foolishly repudiated Gura. Our only option now is to teach him a lesson the hard way."
gura.92.a: "By force it is then!"

gura.93.t: "Zhao Hengti Accepts Our Offer"
gura.93.desc: "Although he used the collapse of HoloCN's legitimacy to strengthen his grip on Hunan, Zhao Hengti was reasonable enough to not resist Gura's offer to reintegrate his lands back into the empire."
gura.93.a: "One step towards a united China!"

gura.94.t: "Zhao Hengti Refuses Our Offer"
gura.94.desc: "Despite his previous history with Gura, some among her cabinet were sceptical that Zhao Hengti would simply hand over his land. They were proven right as Hengti has rejected our offer of peacefully rejoining the empire."
gura.94.a: "By force it is then!"

gura.95.t: "Zhao Hengti Accepts Our Offer"
gura.95.desc: "Having been a longtime ally of Gura since the founding of her empire, it was no surprise that Zhao Hengti would ally with her once again. And despite his rumoured discontent with her efforts to centralise rule, Hengti would reaffirm his loyalty to Gura, swearing to govern his territories on her behalf."
gura.95.a: "One step towards a united China!"

gura.96.t: "Zhao Hengti Refuses Our Offer"
gura.96.desc: "Despite being a long-time ally of Gura, Hengti's true colours were revealed when he refused to reaffirm his loyalty to Gura and rejected her offer of peaceful reintegration."
gura.96.a: "By force it is then!"

gura.97.t: "Integrating Tang Zhengshi's Army"
gura.97.desc: "Tang Zhengshi had fought for Gura's cause since her arrival to China. However despite being a competent officer, some within Gura's cabinet distrusted him. Not only because he was a warlord but because he had ties to another HoloCN idol, Rosalyn. Top officials have advised that if he feels that his position his threated, Tang would simply change his allegiance and bring us into a war with our Southern neighbour."
gura.97.a: "Offer him and his lackeys promotions"
gura.97.b: "Demand his submission now"

gura.98.t: "Tang Zhengshi Accepts Our Offer"
gura.98.desc: "Not only did Tang Zhengshi avoid bloodshed by peacefully reintegrating Hunan back into Gura's empire, but he also accepted her offer of joining her army along with his clique.

gura.98.a: "A victory, but at what cost?"

gura.99.t: "Tang Zhengshi Refuses Our Offer"
gura.99.desc: "Despite offers of becoming a general in Gura's army, Tang Zhengshi had refused her proposal. And worst, he also refused to reintegrate his lands into the empire."
gura.99.a: "By force it is then!"

gura.100.t: "Tang Zhengshi Accepts Our Offer"
gura.100.desc: "In a wise decision, Tang Zhengshi allowed his territory to once again become part of Gura's empire, avoiding unnecessary fighting."

gura.102.t: "Tang Zhengshi Accepts Our Offer"
gura.102.desc: "Many members of Gura's cabinet and military had questioned Tang Zhengshi's loyalty, due to his ties to the idol Rosalyn. However, Zhengshi would prove them wrong after reaffirming his loyalty to Gura, reincorporating his lands back under Gura's domain."

gura.104.t: "Tang Zhengshi Defects!"
gura.104.desc: "While not reaffirming his loyalty to Gura and refusing to incorporate Hunan back into the empire was bad enough, Tang Zhengshi has revealed his true colours. Following Zhengshi's defection to Rosayln, Gura and her cabinet feared that Zhengshi would give her a military advantage by revealing his knowledge of Gura's land and army. The time is right for war, if Gura wishes it."
gura.104.a: "This will not be tolerated"
gura.104.b: "Back down, we can't handle a war"

gura.105.t: "Victory in the Canton War"
gura.105.desc: "The defection of Tang Zhengshi posed a great threat to Gura, as it meant Rosalyn had access to Zhengshi's knowledge of Gura's army and territory. As a result, a preemptive strike was vital to destroy this threat before it got too strong. Thankfully, Gura's superiority in size and tactics was able to defeat Rosalyn's warlord army. In the following peace treaty, Rosalyn was able to remain independent, so long as she ceded small parts of her territory and handed over Tang Zhengshi to us to answer for charges of treason."
gura.105.a: "Proof of our superiority"

gura.106.t: "Failure in the Canton War"
gura.106.desc: "The defection of Tang Zhengshi posed a great threat to Gura, as it meant Rosalyn had access to Zhengshi's knowledge of Gura's army and territory. As a result, a preemptive strike was vital to destroy this threat before it got too strong. Unfortunately, Gura's massive army and endless well of resources could not defeat Rosalyn's army, now led by Zhengshi. To Gura's reluctance, she sought a white peace with Rosalyn to not drag on the war further."
gura.106.a: "Damn!"

gura.107.t: "Integrating Feng Yuxiang's Army"
gura.107.desc: "Feng Yuxiang had a complicated relationship with Gura and her advisors. On one hand, some considered this warlord with pro-socialist leanings to be a threat to Gura's empire. On the other hand, some of Gura's ministers sympathised with his democratic views and he was a respected army commander who fought in the Xinhai Revolution. Regardless, his control over his lands has undermined Gura's authority and as such needs to be dealt with."
gura.107.a: "We're a progressive state aren't we?"
gura.107.b: "Demand his submission now"
gura.107.c: "Just request his loyalty"

gura.108.t: "Feng Yuxiang Accepts Our Offer"
gura.108.desc: "Citing Gura's commitment to democratic principles, Feng Yuxiang has wisely accepted our offer of participating in her government. While this has alienated some conservative voices, many are relieved that he has seen reason and ensured peace."
gura.108.a: "We thought so"

gura.109.t: "Feng Yuxiang Refuses Our Offer"
gura.109.desc: "For some reason Feng Yuxiang has refused Gura's offer, seemingly not confident in Gura's democratic leadership to do so. Furthermore, he has refused any notion of reintegration of his territory. We will have to stamp him out with blood, not words."
gura.109.a: "By force it is"

gura.110.t: "Feng Yuxiang Accepts Our Offer"
gura.110.desc: "Not wanting to cause even more bloodshed in China, Feng Yuxiang has seen reason and has decided to peacefully reintegrate his lands into our state."
gura.110.a: "A victory for China"

gura.111.t: "Feng Yuxiang Refuses Our Offer"
gura.111.desc: "To the surprise of few, Fen Yuxiang had refused to allow her lands to be integrated into Gura's empire as many distrusted his views. However very few had expected the situation to escalate, as reports of armouries being seized and villages rising up began to come from the countryside surrounding Nanjing, making an already fragile situation even worst."
gura.111.a: "Damn it!"

gura.112.t: "Feng Yuxiang Accepts Our Offer"
gura.112.desc: "Feng Yuxiang has graciously accepted Gura's mercy by pledging an oath of loyalty to her. While some still have misgivings over such an act, the fact that Feng has also agreed to integrate his fiefdom into Gura's seems to have cemented his loyalties."
gura.112.a: "A victory for China"

gura.113.t: "Feng Yuxiang Refuses Our Offer"
gura.113.desc: "For some odd reason Feng Yuxiang has rebuffed any avenue of reconciliation from Gura. If his loyalty cannot be ascertained then he will have to be swept aside."
