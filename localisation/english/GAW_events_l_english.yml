gura.1.t: "Jaws Over Beijing"
gura.1.desc: "The time has finally come to destroy the traitors that control our ancient capital of Beijing and begin our steps to Chinese unification. But before our troops march forward, we must order them on what to do when they capture the officials of this fake regime"

gura.4.t: "Yagoo Refuses"
gura.4.desc: "The port cities under the control of the East Asia Mandate, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai, have and will always be rightful Chinese territory. For Yagoo to propose that they be turned into autonomous zones is not just outrageous, but completely insane."

gura.5.t: "Yagoo Refuses to Bend to Pressure"

gura.12.t: "Nene Accepts"
gura.12.desc: "Nene, true to her foolish nature, has willingly opened the gates to our forces and has fled her former nation."
gura.12.a: "A victory for China!"

gura.13.t: "Legacy of the Great Plains War"
gura.13.desc: "It has been over 10 years since Gura arrived in China and a lot has changed. What was once a land divided between different idols and on the verge of being swallowed by the Japanese menace is now a flourishing land rapidly industrialising. Gura having driven out the Japanese is set to reunite the country and restore China's glories. However not all is well as enemies within and without seek to end Gura's rule before she can accomplish her ultimate goal. The unification of China and the expansion of her empire."
gura.13.a: "A"

gura.14.t: "No Clues Found"
gura.14.desc: "Despite the best efforts of our investigators, no clues about the alleged He Yinqing plot have been found. Perhaps, he really is innocent and we should let it go to try our luck elsewhere. Hopefully this would not lead to any drastic consequences"
gura.14.a: "Damn"

gura.15.t: "A Suspect Found!"
gura.15.desc: "After a delicate search, we managed to find someone related to the He Yinqing Plot. We should follow this lead and take action. The suspect will likely try to leave the nation so it's now or never."
gura.15.a: "Perhaps the plot is beginning to unravel"

gura.16.t: "The Trial of He Yingqing"
gura.16.desc: "With the man the plot is named after and being proven guilty we must decide what to do with He Yinqing. What happens next might change our nation forever. Treason can not be taken lightly"
gura.16.a: "Treason means death"
gura.16.b: "His concerns were in the best interests of China, release him"

gura.17.t: "Silence in the Halls"
gura.17.desc: "All clues we had of the He Yingping plot have come to a dead end. We know that they still exist but they have successfully avoided our grasp."
gura.17.a: "So close yet so far..."

gura.18.t: "Failed Assasination Attempt!"
gura.18.desc: "placeholder"
gura.18.a: "How could we lose such a man..."

gura.19.t: "A Question of Governance"
gura.19.desc: "To run our Empire effectively we need a new and competent Prime Minister. We need to choose someone who will help lead our government."
gura.19.a: "Xu Shichang is such a smart guy!"
gura.19.b: "Chen Kuilong is such a wise guy!"
gura.19.c: "Tang Shaoli is such a progressive guy!"

gura.20.t: "Xu Shichang's Constitution"
gura.20.desc: "Within a meeting room in the halls of parliament, a group of various ministers met with Gura to discuss the future of their government. Among them the conservative leader, Xu Shichang has proposed the adoption of a new constitution. His idea, named “Qing monarchy with constitutional restraints” states for the creation of a constitutional monarchy, with a Qing Emperor or Empress as its central figurehead. This proposal was met with severe backlash from most of the men in the room who stated that monarchy has brought nothing but hardship to China during its vast history, and that the way forward was a true democracy. The decision however was ultimately left to Gura on how she wished to govern her nation"
gura.20.a: "Replace “empress” with “president” and you have a deal."
gura.20.b: "I'd like to be the empress"

gura.21.t: "Who Shall be the President?"
gura.21.desc: "With Xu Shichang's constitution being rewritten at the behest of Gura and the other ministers, one question remains. Who should become the president to lead this nation to a brighter future?”"
gura.21.a: "That'd be me!"

gura.22.t: "Xu Shichang Accepts the Ammendment"
gura.22.desc: "Having heard Xu Shichang's proposed constitution, Gura would propose that she be made the new Chinese monarch, much to the surprise of the other men in the room. But nevertheless Xu Shichang accepted Gura's request"
gura.22.a: "I am now Empress of all China!"

gura.23.t: "Xu Shichang Rejects the Ammendment"
gura.23.desc: "Much to Gura's outrage, Xu Shichang rejected Gura's demand to be made China's reigning monarch. As a result, she would reject Xu Shichang's proposed constitution, instead opting to find someone else to write a better one."
gura.23.a: "Fine, I'll just go to Chen Kuliong!"
gura.23.b: "Fine, I'll just go to Tang Shaoli"
gura.23.c: "Who even needs these guys anyways?!"

gura.24.t: "An Attempt on Gura's Life!"
gura.24.desc: "With Xu Shichang's constitution being rejected, Gura instead chose to work with the more die-hard monarchist Chen Kuliong. This raised alarm bells among numerous high ranking ministers, especially the still embittered Xu Shichang. A few days later, as Gura and Kuliong met at her residence to discuss implementing his constitution, two men would storm the building with the intent of killing the two. Thankfully they would be subdued before they could cause any more harm. After lengthy interrogation, one of the assassins broke and revealed shocking details. They were members of the New Xinzhonghui entrusted by Xu Shichang who ordered them to assassinate Gura and Kuliong, fearing they would forcibly restore an absolute monarch. Not only had a radical group made an attempt on Gura's life, but it seemed that one of the nation's most capable politicians had been swayed to their side."
gura.24.a: "It seems I have no choice."

gura.25.t: "Blackmail!"
gura.25.desc: "Following Gura's decision to adopt Tang Shaoli's constitution, he would visit Gura at her residence. As both of them drank tea and made small talk, Shaoli changed the conversation as he revealed something he knew. He revealed to her that he knew her true ambitions. To declare herself as Empress of China, the complete opposite of his republican and democratic beliefs. He threatened to reveal this goal to not just her cabinet, but to the whole nation as well. However, he also stated that he would forget this encounter and keep this secret under one condition. That he be given further powers as the new Prime Minister."
gura.25.a: "Hell no!"

gura.26.t: "Chen Kuilong's Constitution"
gura.26.desc: "Chen Kuilong approached Guraoff ruling the nation as an absolute monarchy, like the old Qing emperors. However, to agree to this would undermine Gura's founding principles of democracy with his ideas of monarchy restoration. He assured the shark girl that such a transformation would not only strengthen the state, by centralising all of authority in the hands of one person, but also would get her the Mandate of Heaven and ability to unite all of China under her banner. And with her popularity among the citizens and glory from the past victories, she would certainly make an excellent empress.\n\nGura admitted that becoming an absolute monarch was a tempting offer, but she also knew that such a radical political manoeuvre might destroy her nation. With republicans holding a majority in the government and warlords seeking for any sign of instability to proclaim independence - perhaps she should compromise and hold back her ambitions by creating a constitutional monarchy, to pacify the opposition."
gura.26.a: "Make it a constitutional monarchy and we have a deal"
gura.26.b: "I agree to all of it"

gura.27.t: "Treason!?"
gura.27.desc: "Chinese pro-republicans were always sceptical towards Gura, suspecting that she was going to usurp all of the state power for herself. So when the rumours about her plans to restore the monarchy in China reached them - republicans weren't surprised and prepared to take action. During an annual government meeting they confronted Gura, accusing her of treason to the state and threatening to arrest her if she does not abandon her monarchist leanings."
gura.27.a: "You misheard, I support the republic!"
gura.27.b: "*POW* *POW* *POW*"

gura.28.t: "Tang Shaoli's Constitution"
gura.28.desc: "Gura's next candidate was the reformer, Tang Shaoli. His proposal stated that China should adhere to Hololive principles and become a republic. Elected president shall be an official head of the state, sharing the power with his cabinet and parliament. Each Chinese citizen would be entitled to freedom of speech, freedom of expression, access to fair working conditions and that companies must adhere to strict labour laws to protect their workers from harm and abuse."
gura.28.a: "Accept, this is fine for me"
gura.28.b: "Uhhh, I'll go by someone else"

gura.29.t: "Encounter with the New-Xinzhonghui"
gura.29.desc: "Tang had expected Gura to reject his proposed constitution. As a result, he shouted 'For the Republic! Death to Tyrants!', prompting armed men from the New Xinzhonghui to emerge from windows within the house or behind shrubs. As they trained their guns on Gura, she and her guards took cover behind a flipped over table as they took aim at them. Tang Shaoli made his intentions clear. If Gura does not accept his proposal, then she will die at the hands of the New Xinzhonghui."
gura.29.a: "Uhh yeah of course I support him"
gura.29.b: "*POW* *POW* *POW*"

gura.30.t: "Dawn of the Atlantean Dynasty"
gura.30.desc: "After countless backroom deals, political manoeuvring, internal division and hardship, Gura is finally set to secure her vision of China once and for all. To establish her new dynasty that will unite all of China and spread prosperity, equality, progress and harmony across the entire empire. Under the newly proclaimed Atlantean Dynasty, this new Chinese Empire shall bring China to a new era."
gura.30.a: "'I am ready'"

gura.31.t: "Riots in Nanjing!"
gura.31.desc: "Over the radio, Gura announced the formation of her Atlantean Dynasty, not just to the citizens of Nanjing, but to across China and the world. However, reception to the proclamation was not as positive as Gura had hoped. Immediately following it, riots broke out in the streets as people, mainly young students, scholars and others protested what they saw as the return of the flawed Chinese monarchist system. To make matters worse, Gura received a letter from Yagoo, stating his disapproval regarding her most recent decision."
gura.31.a: "Woops"

gura.32.t: "A Sigh of Relief"
gura.32.desc: "Following the countless political intrigue between various high ranking ministers, Gura decided to address not just her cabinet, but also the entire nation. Over the radio, Gura would address everything from the rumours regarding her behind the scenes politics, to the attempt on her life at the hands of the New Xinzhonghui. To the relief of many, Gura would reaffirm her stance of maintaining democracy, standing by her pledge to defending the republic."
gura.32.a: "Long Live the Republic!"

gura.33.t: "A Sigh of Relief"
gura.33.desc: "Despite being unpopular among other ministers, Gura had favoured Xu Shichang's proposed constitution, as it combined her dream as Empress of China with the principles of democracy that had helped bring her nation into the modern era. After several days of talks behind the scenes, Gura would make a proclamation that rang across China and the world. The adoption of Xu Shichang's 'Qing Monarchy with Constitutional Restraints' system, proclaiming herself Empress of China while stating her intent to maintain an elected parliament, under a newly written constitution."
gura.33.a: "The Atlantean Dynasty has risen."

gura.34.t: "A Question of Antis?"
gura.34.desc: "There are some in this country that still have doubts on whether a country ruled by a Hololiver can still work. In the past we have ostracised them from our political system, but if we really are to establish democracy, maybe we could invite them in for some goodwill?"
gura.34.a: "They'll behave if they're in the government"
gura.34.b: "Evidently this system has failed"

gura.35.t: "A Question of the HoloCNs?"
gura.35.desc: "A question has arisen over the fate of those loyal to the HoloCNs. While they are Hololivers, relations with our state has not been the greatest. Despite this, we could attempt reconciliation with them should we allow them to become part of our nascent democracy."
gura.35.a: "They'll behave if integrated"
gura.35.b: "Evidently this system has failed"

gura.36.t: "Role of Gura?"
gura.36.desc: "While Gura herself had been fairly supportive of our ongoing democratic reforms, she has expressed various misgivings regarding the scale of the reforms that are being made. She is worried that by allowing for greater voices to everyone, antis or former HoloCNs could jeopardise the stability of the state by opening up the country to subversive forces. Given these concerns, should we continue our efforts at instituting the Mio Model?"
gura.36.a: "Respect the principles of the Hololive Republic"
gura.36.b: "Evidently this system has failed"

gura.37.t: "Future of the Guramintang"
gura.37.desc: "The Gura Nationalist Party, made up of many ardent supporters of the current regime, has found it necessary to transition to allow more elements of democracy in its ranks. As our democratic reforms continue, its new advocacy for democracy is therefore fundamental to ensuring these reforms succeed. Can they convince the other disparate factions of both the party and the nation to work together for a better society?"
gura.37.a: "The Guramintang crushes the competition!"
gura.37.b: "The Guramintang crashes in the polls!"
gura.37.c: "We need to compromise, ally with the nationalists"
gura.37.d: "We need to compromise, ally with the Progressives"

gura.38.t: "Failure of Mio Democracy"
gura.38.desc: "Unfortunately democracy does not seem suited for the course of our nation. Despite our best efforts, ultimately the democratic experiment had not captured both popular and governmental interests."
gura.38.a: "Damn"

gura.39.t: "Moderate success of Mio Democracy"
gura.39.desc: "It wasn't easy, but we have managed to firmly get our country on the track for democratic success. While there are still various issues with integrating the disparate political factions into our new democracy, with time these growing pains would surely give way to a fully-functioning stable country."
gura.39.a: "Better than nothing I suppose"

gura.40.t: "REPLACE_ME"
gura.40.desc: "We have surpassed even the dreams of the biggest democratic idealist here. With the unparalleled success of the Mio Model, we have proven that it is possible to reconcile our political foes in pursuit of common peace for all."
gura.40.a: "Bring out the champagne!" 

gura.41.t: "The Council of Corporations"
gura.41.desc: "A new day dawns, as we have rid ourselves of the old and corrupt parliament. In its place we shall have a new parliament, composed of the most loyal party members, powerful industrialists and representatives from the largest trade unions across the country. With them by Gura's side, she will lead this country to its well deserved glory."
gura.41.a: "Truly a new day for China!"

gura.42.t: "Collectivisation and Conglomeration"
gura.42.desc: "Reforming our economic system is the first step into a more prosperous future. We have two economic systems to choose from, both with their own benefits and flaws. A free capitalist system, or collectivisation, where the state owns the means of production"
gura.42.a: "Let the free market be"
gura.42.b: "Everything under the state"

gura.43.t: "Han Supremacy"
gura.43.desc: "The Han Chinese people make up a majority of our population. But even then, China consists of many peoples, each with unique traditions, faiths and languages. In an ever changing world we must decide the policy regarding China's majority. While it would be a progressive move to support China's many ethnic groups, the council is more in favour of maintaining the supremacy of the Han people."
gura.43.a: "Is this even a question?"
gura.43.b: "One China, many nations"

gura.44.t: "Industrialization vs Ruralisation"
gura.44.desc: "Historically China has always been a rural nation. Our farm lands are world renown, feeding millions at home and abroad with the best crops our fertile land and hard working peasants can offer. But will this last forever? As our council is made of numerous industrialists, many are in favour of focusing our efforts on expanding industrialization. But equally important is supporting our peasants and the development of our rapidly expanding cities, lest we run the risk of a communist uprising from the rapid industrialization and mass displacement of labour."
gura.44.a: "We are a nation of peasants"
gura.44.b: "The proletariat are a hotbed of revolution, a balance is needed"
gura.44.c: "We need to develop our cities"

gura.45.t: "Centralization vs Decentralization"
gura.45.desc: "China is a vast nation, with every corner of this nation filled with different people who have distinct traditions, faiths and languages, residing in lands that look foreign to the average citizen within Inner China. Historically, past dynasties have relied on local governors and warlords to maintain control over these vast regions. However the Council proposed that governance over China be more centralised to better manage the resources and populations of these provinces. Such an effort would be beneficial, but would also take time and may cause outrage among more autonomous populations."
gura.45.a: "Everything in the state"
gura.45.b: "Local governors know best"

gura.46.t: "Foreign Assets"
gura.46.desc: "For the past hundred years, foreign companies have operated on Chinese soil. While they bring revenue and jobs for our people, some also exploit our people with harsh working conditions and small wages. They are also of great concern to the industrialists that are in our Council, as they are afraid these foreign industries will outperform and overtake their businesses. For these reasons, much of the council is in favour of nationalising these foreign assets. But such a drastic decision may come with consequences, both economically and diplomatically."
gura.46.a: "Nationalise them but sell them off"
gura.46.b: "Nationalise and keep them"
gura.46.c: "“Leave them alone"

gura.47.t: "View of Antis"
gura.47.desc: "The unfortunate reality is that some people are not willing to accept the good that Gura has done for the nation. Some are so extreme that they will do whatever it takes to resist the influence of Gura and those who support her. While Gura is willing to leave these people alone, the Council sees them as a threat to China's stability and as such they call for them to be branded as traitors."
gura.47.a: "Leave them alone"
gura.47.b: "Hang the dogs"

gura.48.t: "Foreign Policy"
gura.48.desc: "Having consolidated our government and economy, the time has come to look out onto the world stage. Some in the council advocate for isolationism, focusing our efforts inwards to help our people, especially our Han citizens. Others say we should reunite all of China under our banner, reclaiming the old borders of the Qing empire while others say we should go further, claiming more territory to gain more territory and resources."
gura.48.a: "Our priority is the Han people"
gura.48.b: "We should return to the borders of the Qing..."
gura.48.c: "...or we could go beyond that"

gura.49.t: "Fate of the Unions"
gura.49.desc: "With mass industrialization came many benefits but also downsides. Low wages, long hours and horrific working conditions as well as many others. As a result, numerous labour unions arose to give the workers representation. However, so many different unions not supervised by the state can lead to the spread of ideas harmful to the state. The Council has suggested that we reorganise the unions into more manageable and state owned ones, while some suggest shutting them down altogether."
gura.49.a: "Leave them alone"
gura.49.b: "Consolidate the unions"
gura.49.c: "Crush them"

gura.50.t: "The Blue Shirts"
gura.50.desc: "The upheaval and turmoil leading up to the Council's formation has shown that even a 'stable' country is vulnerable to the ambitions of the treacherous. As such, a number of Council members have proposed the creation of a paramilitary force loyal solely to the Council and Gura, similar to the Usagi Loyalist Front in Italy. Named the Blue Shirts, they will be tasked with guarding Council members, cracking down on any dissent, and fighting alongside the regular army on the frontlines."
gura.50.a: "Why not?"
gura.50.b: "We are a nation of workers, not thugs"

gura.51.t: "Spending Policy"
gura.51.desc: "Recently, Council members have come to us for a change in how we conduct our economic policy. They assert that, as the market is inherently volatile especially in these changing times, one must call for more government intervention through vigorous spending to ensure that our economy remains stable. While these ideas have attracted support among a wide faction of the Council, some still see this as an infringement of the rights of the free market."
gura.51.a: "Keynes' ideas are pretty nifty"
gura.51.b: "What!? We need to balance our books"

gura.52.t: "Conclusion of the Council"
gura.52.desc: "The current session of the Grand Council of Corporations has concluded. The particular session was particularly consequential as it determined the extent of reform that the government intended to pursue. When all was said in done, it was determined that what the nation needed was…"
gura.52.a: "a cultural revolution!"
gura.52.b: "an assurance of the status-quo"

gura.53.t: "Cult of the Shark"
gura.53.desc: "It took many months, but Gawr Gura has finally taken a commanding position in China. The Atlantean dynasty, now unchallenged, has successfully navigated through these times of troubles, and now has captured the mandate of the heavens. The attempts by the Council to usurp her authority has failed. Together, our sovereign Gawr Gura, the saviour of the Chinese people, will build a new China that all will admire!"
gura.53.a: "Without Gura there would be no China!"

gura.54.t: "Supremacy of the Council"
gura.54.desc: "Having consolidated its power, the Council of Corporations has finally secured enough influence to be the sole ruling authority within the empire. No longer will Gura have to govern all of China herself, as she has a strong council behind her back."
gura.54.a: "ShAAark!"

gura.55.t: "Political deadlock"
gura.55.desc: "Despite their efforts, neither the Council nor Gura have been able to surpass one or the other for political influence. As a result, the government has been completely deadlocked, with neither side being able to make a decision or pass a bill into law."
gura.55.a: "That's not what we intended"

# gura.56.t: "REPLACE_ME"
# gura.56.desc: "Placeholder"
# gura.56.a: "REPLACE_ME"

gura.57.t: "A New Republic"
gura.57.desc: "With its new position secured, the Council of Corporations has set about to shape China to fit its model of governance. Inspired by Kiryu Coco and Usagi Pekora, important industries have been nationalised, or given to loyal industrialists in the Council, replacing the capitalist economy with a corporatist system. Having rid China of petty democratic opposition and infighting, the Council has directed all resources to achieving its goal. Turning the nation into an industrial and military powerhouse to unify all of China."
gura.57.a: "Nothing outside the state, nor against the state."

gura.58.t: "Eyes to the World"
gura.58.desc: "With our position in China consolidated, we may once again bring China back to the world stage. As the world degenerates further into conflict with the increasing tensions between the LHS and Resistance, China under Gura is in a prime position to bring our own options onto the table."
gura.58.a: "The world is mine!"

gura.59.t: "A Grand Coronation"
gura.59.desc: "The coronation of our Empress Gawr Gura occurred today. In a departure from previous coronations of Chinese monarchs, however, the occasion has been marked with a glorious ceremony befitting Gura's position as Empress. The heavens smile on us as we have its mandate to rule."
gura.59.a: "Truly Magnificent"

gura.60.t: "Draft a Constitution"
gura.60.desc: "There are many factions within the monarchist movement, all with their own model on how the monarchy should be conducted. As our new dynasty prepares to bare its fangs, and a new monarchist constitution established, we must decide once and for all what model we should choose. Leaving some room for democracy should ensure popular unrest be kept to a minimum with their privileges secure, but Gura is the newly-ordained Daughter of Heaven after all, with the state as her witness..."
gura.60.a: "Insert same vague notions of democracy"
gura.60.b: "We demand loyalty to the Empress"

gura.61.t: "Republican Elements"
gura.61.desc: "While ruling all of China uncontested sounds like a good idea, past events have proven that taking away too much of the people's freedom will only end in disaster. As such, the adoption of some democratic reforms such as an elected cabinet and governors will keep the people calm, lowering the chance of rebellion and allowing Gura to rule peacefully."
gura.61.a: "The people shall have rights!"

gura.62.t: "Divine Rule"
gura.62.desc: "Gura has done much for China. From saving it from petty warlords and Japanese imperialism, to turning it into an industrial powerhouse. As such, it is safe to say that Gura has earned the Mandate of Heaven to reign supremely as China's empress. Like the great Emperors and Empresses before her, Gura shall guide China into a new golden age, not bound by bureaucratic deadlock or squabbling ministers. Gura's words will be obeyed without question and upheld with the utmost loyalty."
gura.62.a: "The Heavens shine brightly on Gura."

gura.63.t: "Policy Towards Ina"
gura.63.desc: "To the North of our country lies Manchuria and Korea, under the control of Ina's Tentaculy. While we have maintained good relations with Ina during the past few years, many are suspicious of the Tentacult's true ambitions and unpredictability."
gura.63.a: "Bring her into the HoloCN Federation"
gura.63.b: "We need a reliable ally to our North"
gura.63.c: "One crown, one empire"

gura.64.t: "Ina Accepts Integration"
gura.64.desc: "To our delight, Ina has agreed to peacefully integrate the Tentacult and her nation into our empire. While it will take some time to fully annex Manchuria and Korea, so long as Ina can convince them of our good intentions, the Takodachis will fully support joining our empire."
gura.64.a: "Welcome to the empire, Ina"

gura.65.t: "Ina Rejects Integration"
gura.65.desc: "Ina has responded to our request for peaceful integration. She has refused, citing that the Tentacult has its own goals on the world stage. With this in mind, we must decide on what to do with the Tentacult."
gura.65.a: "Leave them be"
gura.65.b: "How fast can we march into Manchuria?"

gura.66.t: "Ina Accepts Our Alliance"
gura.66.desc: "Following our request for an alliance, we have received word that Ina has accepted. With this alliance, both the Imperial Army and the forces of the Tentacult will fight side by side against any threat against both our nations."
gura.66.a: "A win for mutual security."

gura.67.t: "Ina Rejects Our Alliance"
gura.67.desc: "Ina rejecting our proposed alliance has raised questions within parliament. While some are in favour of leaving Ina alone, others call for us to retake our rightfully claimed territory of Manchuria and to secure our northern borders."
gura.67.a: "Leave them be"
gura.67.b: "How fast can we march into Manchuria?"

gura.68.t: "Policy towards HoloCNs"
gura.68.desc: "The HoloCNs are in an interesting position for us. They did arrive in this world along with the rest of the Hololivers, but they have largely grown estranged from the Hololiver world order, instead degenerating into various warlord factions. With the geopolitical situation rapidly shifting though, we need a united China more than ever.  Should we negotiate with the HoloCNs to try and get them to see reason?"
gura.68.a: "We should integrate them, we need a united front"
gura.68.b: "The HoloCN Federation from this day, is dead"

gura.69.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses to Submit!"
gura.69.desc: "Unfortunately for [FROM.GetName], they have refused to see reason. Instead of accepting one united China under Gura's command, they have instead let their own pride and ego cloud their judgements. In the face of such insolence, the only response we must do is to proceed with unification forcefully to ensure the survival of China."
gura.69.a: "War is the only option then"

gura.70.t: "Disaster in Nanking"
gura.70.desc: "A major protest against our rule is taking place in Nanjing. While this is normally something we could stamp out, this particular protest has become a challenge to put down due to the sheer scale of the protest. As our legitimacy suffers, antis and opportunists will most definitely use these demonstrations for their own ends and already the state that we have worked so hard to build is beginning to tumble down."
gura.70.a: "Uh oh"

gura.71.t: "Doris Folds!"
gura.71.desc: "Wonderous news from the province of Shandong, as Doris has agreed to be incorporated within our empire. This annexation has not just given us access to Doris' resources but is also one more step before full control of the Yellow Sea."
gura.71.a: "Shandong is ours again!"

gura.72.t: "Yogiri Folds!"
gura.72.desc: "A message from Taiyuan has arrived. To our delight, it stated Yogiri's intentions to hand over her territory over to us. After years of division, the mountains of Shanxi and Shaanxi are under the fold of the Chinese Empire once again"
gura.72.a: "Our flag flies over the North once more."

gura.73.t: "Rosalyn Folds"
gura.73.desc: "Rosalyn's reign over Guangdong has come to an end, following her acceptance of handing over the territory over to Gura's empire. Guangdong's resources and people will prove useful, as well as the ports giving us easier access to the South China Sea"
gura.73.a: "Once more we rule Canton!"

gura.74.t: "Aria Folds!"
gura.74.desc: "To our delighted surprise, Artia has agreed to become a vassal of our Empire. We always expected Artia to put up more of a fight, to the point where we had planned for fighting to break out. But it seems Artia was much more practical than we initially thought."
gura.74.a: "“A victory for diplomacy."

gura.75.t: "Civia Folds!"
gura.75.desc: "From the ancient city of Chongqing, we have received word that Civia has agreed to surrender the province of Sichuan to Gura and become a vassal of the Atlantean Empire. Chongqing, the innermost port along the main Yangtze river, is finally ours again."
gura.75.a: "We control the Yangtze once more."

gura.76.t: "Echo Folds!"
gura.76.desc: "After an arduous time, with negotiations seemingly going nowhere, Echo has finally seen our ways and agreed to submit to Gura's rule. Her resources and influence will prove useful to our empire as we strive for greater goals across the world."
gura.76.a: "We have subdued the illusive gangster"

gura.77.t: "Doris Wants Autonomy"
gura.77.desc: "Before the full annexation of Shandong, its ruler Doris made an interesting demand. She asked that she be granted the title of Baroness within our Empire's hierarchy in order to rule Shandong on behalf of Gura."
gura.77.a: "What a ridiculous request"
gura.77.b: "We see no harm in it"

gura.78.t: "Yogiri Wants Democracy"
gura.78.desc: "As negotiations for the incorporation of Shanxi into the Empire went on, Yogiri put forward a request controversial among Gura and her ministers. She demanded that her territory be granted a special democratic system, allowed to elect governors and representatives."
gura.78.a: "Absolutely not!"
gura.78.b: "Whatever, sure"

gura.79.t: "Rosalyn Wants Corporatism"
gura.79.desc: "Rosalyn's latest request during the integration negotiations was an interesting one. Her request was that Guangdong adopt a special economic system based around Corporatism, where her regional government and loyal corporations control the territory's resources."
gura.79.a: "This will compromise our economy!"
gura.79.b: "If it benefits the province, so be it."

gura.80.t: "Artia Threatens Us!"
gura.80.desc: "In response to our offer for assimilation, Artia instead stands defiant, stating that she will drive back any attempt of annexation with her Yunnan army. Some of our ministers think that fighting Artia isn't worth the bloodshed, while others think that the only way to make her submit is to show we are more than capable of fighting her."
gura.80.a: "This isn't worth it."
gura.80.b: "Enact a show of force."

gura.81.t: "Civia wants minority rights"
gura.81.desc: "As we prepared to integrate Sichuan, Civia made an important counter-offer. She stated that if we were to annex her province, then we must give equal rights and treatment to Sichuan's various minority groups. Specifically the Tibetians, Yi, Qiang, and Nakhi people, as well as other ethnic minorities."
gura.81.a: "They shall prosper under our empire"
gura.81.b: "The Han will always be the dominant people."

gura.82.t: "Echo Wants Influence"
gura.82.desc: "The most odd and controversial request we have gotten came from Echo. She requested that she be granted immunity from the government, allowing her to continue her illicit activities unimpeded. She also asked that we appoint ministers who're sympathic to her, as well as divert money to her organisation."
gura.82.a: "This may work in our favour."
gura.82.b: "Working with gangsters? Never!"

gura.83.t: "Our Show of Force Successful!"
gura.83.desc: "Our intimidation of Artia seemed to have paid off. The soldiers of the Imperial army were able to push back and rout the Yunnan border troops, showing that Artia's forces are inferior to our army."
gura.83.a: "It seems that Aria was just a paper tiger"

gura.84.t: "Our Show of Force Failed!"
gura.84.desc: "The attack on the border proved to be a disaster, as we have underestimated the defences along the Yunnan mountains. If anything it has inspired Artia to hold her ground. We have no other choice but to mobilise the entire army and fight."
gura.84.a: "We shall match force with greater force!"

gura.85.t: "Artia Refuses to Submit"
gura.85.desc: "Despite our victory at the border, Artia intends to fight to the bitter end to defend her country. Already we have received reports of more troops from the Yunnan army marching towards their defences in the mountains. If Artia is content with fighting, then we are obliged to meet her in combat"
gura.85.a: "Our troops shall march on Kunming!"

gura.86.t: "Artia Submits"
gura.86.desc: "Seeing the superiority of our soldiers at the border skirmish, Artia seems to have realised that resisting our army will only result in unnecessary bloodshed and destruction. As a result, we have received a message from Artia stating that she intends to submit Gura's rule."
gura.86.a: "Once more our flag flies over Yunnan."
