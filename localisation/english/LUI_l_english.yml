LUI_takane_lui_desc: "Takane Lui is the local despot of Yucatan, ruling from atop of a metaphorical pyramid of wealth as Latin America's gambling queen. Despite her self declared neutrality in the region, her true allegiance lies with Laplus and HoloX, a secret society bent on world domination.\n\nLui's story begins as a well known socialite in the upper class of Yucatan state in Mexico, becoming a local celebrity. She used her status to get close to the rich capitalists where she played her way into having several wealthy landowners hands, and many of them 'died suddenly' where their properties were 'conveniently left' in her name. She advocated for Yucatan's independence with her wealth and influence, and got the opportunity as Mexico collapsed under the Hololive Revolution. After the revolution, she built numerous casinos and propped up a strong tourist industry to eventually build enough wealth and power to take over Yucatan entirely.\n\nAs the 1930s rolled around and the Great Depression set it, it destroyed Yucatan's economy to the point of ruin. Lui played off the LHS to get funding by citing threat of invasion from the pro-Resistance Kanata up North. Lui must now work to rebuild Yucatan's economy and survive in order to continue the grand plan of world conquest laid out by HoloX's members."
