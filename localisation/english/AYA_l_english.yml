AYA_nakiri_ayame: "Nakiri Ayame"
AYA_nakiri_ayame_desc: "Nakari Ayame is the ruling president of Argentina, currently in her fourth term. Since coming to power Ayame has become quite popular thanks to her reforms, bringing wealth and prosperity to Argentina. She is also one of the founding members of the LHS and a loyalist to Yagoo at heart.\n\nUpon arrival in Argentina, Ayame stayed in Buenos Aires for the next few years, gaining an interest in politics. After witnessing the 1905 Argentine Revolution, Ayame became disillusioned with the revolutionaries, believing that proper reform can come peacefully through the ruling party. After more years of political turmoil, Ayame joined the Argentine government as a congresswoman. Following a turbulent election campaign, Ayame would be elected President of Argentina, becoming the first elected female leader in the 20th century. Things would not go smoothly at first, as Ayame had to put down a series of violent strikes and riots using the military and she worked hard to rebuild Buenos Aires. As she worked to stabilize Argentina, chaos gripped Brazil to the north, as Aqua led revolutionary forces against the Brazilian government. After pleas from the civilian populace and with the support of Yagoo, Ayame would send her forces into Brazil to contain the chaos, annexing its southern border states much to the protest of Aqua.\n\nAs the years rolled on, Ayame would continue her work to reform Argentina. Argentina's Congress would vote to allow consecutive terms, meaning that Ayame had no term limits should she be re-elected as president. Despite problems involving anarchist revolts in Patagonia, Ayame would continue to build Argentina into a new and modern nation, including helping found the LHS alongside other Yagoo loyalists world wide. As she enters her fourth term, Ayame must once again decide how to guide her people as the world descends further into chaos."
