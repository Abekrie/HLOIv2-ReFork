SUB_oozora_subaru_desc: "Subaru stands as the warden of the LHS world, her hawk -- or perhaps duck,  eyes watching over the rest of the world keenly. She is Yagoos sword and shield, both the strike force and final line of defense for the League. Subaru and her Federation have played a critical role in the history of the LHS, without her the very ideals and history of the LHS may have formed completely differently than how we know it today. So now stands Subaru, as she tries to unite her people and all the world behind the LHS banner she so proudly carries.\n\nOne of Subarus earliest actions of great importance was her writing "Onze Missie", a book written in 1905, which spread the ideas of Hololivism all across the world. Subarus' writing and loud voice fueled the rapid spread of Hololive ideology across the globe.  After the Treaty of Brugg, Subaru found herself in charge of the Netherlands, an economic power that dominated its neighboring territories, several of which were heavily aligned towards Subaru, as she had protected them during the great war.\n\nTherefore after the conflict it was little surprise that, when put to a vote, all of her neighboring states and even several states beyond her borders agreed to join Subaru and be forged into a greater, more prosperous nation. The Netherlands was reborn anew into an even greater form, the Subatomo Federation, under the protective and fierce leadership of Subaru. Subaru must now maintain the careful balance of power between the different factions and coalitions of the Federation, all while fending off foreign powers who seek to snuff out Subarus bright torch of Yagooism. If anyone is able to do it, though, it will be none other than Subaru."
