MAR_houshou_marine: "Houshou Marine"
MAR_houshou_marine_desc: "Houshou Marine is the all powerful pirate queen of the Caribbean. The Horny Pirate uses her natural charisma and powerful navy to rule the Antilles region and keep control of the Atlantic sea trade. The coasts of North and South America are torn asunder at the presence of her pirate fleet that constantly raids the industries and settlements along the water, while Marine's control of the Panama Canal also maintains economic leverage over maritime trade.\n\nDespite the power of Marine's fleet in the region, her rule in reality hangs by a thread held together by her superb charisma and the economy of her “nation” barely scrapes by through violent coastal raids and LHS relief funds. The regions of Marine's territory are distanced by individual islands separated by French, English and Spanish influences which makes national cohesion incredibly difficult. The government is a kleptocracy headed by Marine herself along with a handful of Great War era crony admirals and colonial administrators. The all powerful Marine Pirate Fleet is the largest navy in the world but is in reality a cobbled together armada of stolen Great War era warships that are massively outdated by current standards and consumes hundreds of gallons of oil every time they raid.\n\nHoushou Marine currently sits at a great moment of decision for her nation as she knows that her current path of piracy cannot be sustained; she cannot keep raiding coasts forever nor can her fleet's resources remain afloat forever. Marine must reform her band of pirates into a modern nation if she wants to maintain her rule over the Caribbean and grow beyond an impoverished nation that thrives on war. Or perhaps, war is what will bring Marine and her followers salvation…"
