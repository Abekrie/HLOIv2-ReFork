WAT_watame_tsunomaki: "Tsunomaki Watame"
WAT_watame_tsunomaki_desc: "Tsunomaki Watame is the despotic ruler of Tibet and the largest pro-Resistance nation in East Asia and China region. She maintains a loose and questionable grip on Tibet in her kleptocratic regime, controlling with military repression and copious amounts of Asacoco drugs. Watame's soft disposition towards her subjects are always appreciated though and she always tries her best to do the right thing, albeit misguided by asacoco use.\n\nWatame's lands are one of the largest producers, exporters and users of asacoco worldwide, and serves as a nexus of Resistance operations in East Asia. However because of the landlocked nature of Watame's lands most trade and Resistance funding is done through the Resistance friendly Matsuri. The lack of industrialization and widespread poverty make development an issue, also compounded by the national asacoco addiction crisis. The asacoco cannot simply be rid of as the drug export makes up a sizable amount of income for Watame's nation.\n\nWatame remains isolated in a sea of nations that can threaten her existence with next to no allies to speak of. Watame must overcome her nation's rural lifestyle and push industrialization to survive. In regards to the asacoco epidemic across Tibet, she mustchoose whether to abandon asacoco production or continue embracing it wholesale and push production to benefit her economy. The future of Watame's nation lies ultimately in her decision in dealing with asacoco and moving Tibet out of medieval living standards."
