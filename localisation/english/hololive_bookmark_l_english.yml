  YAG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Cover Confederacy, known colloquially as Yagooslavia, was pushed into the spotlight after the Belgrade Declaration in 1919 united the territories of Yagoo, A-Chan and Hitomi Chris under one collective leadership. Being one of the leading nations in the Treaty of Brugg and the Geneva Agreement allowed Yagooslavia to expand its influence dramatically within the Hololive world and by 1927, formalized the 'League of Hololive States' which granted more power towards the nation. Despite its aging fleet and infrastructire, the Cover Confederacy still stand out as a great power with clear global hegemony over the current status quo."
  SUB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Originating from the Benelux, the Subatomo Federation is a multi-ethnic parliamentary monarchy, made up of Dutch, French, Germans, Ashkenazi and more, which is bound together by the rule of law set by Subaru and her advisors in 1920 which ensured the pre-existing systems of democracy and freedom of the press in the region. Although its shipping industry was mauled during the early 1930s, the federation stil has a much stronger economy, standard of living and confidence level in their government than other Hololive states. Combined with a sizeable, modern military; the Subatomo Federation is easily one of the most influential nations within the LHS."
  GAW_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "All started with a single 'A'. The crowds roared."
  CPG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Matsuri is an energetic, expressive, and chaotic individual who seems to enjoy doing outrageous things purely for their comedic value."
  RUS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Rushia is a soft-spoken, somewhat naive girl who panics easily when playing video games. While she is usually innocent and kind, she can occasionally become enraged and scream in an uncharacteristically beast-like manner before regaining her composure"
  PEK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Pekora hails from the nation of Pekoland, where she claims she is a member of royalty. While not much is currently known about Pekoland, it is assumed its native denizens are; like Pekora; humans with rabbit-ears and comparatively long lifespans, and that the rabbit-motif apparent in Pekora's fashion and accessories is significant to their culture."
  AQA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Aqua is a bumbling airhead who somehow manages to become the victim of every joke she gets involved in. She is also childish and prone to throwing tantrums, smashing her keyboard, and hyperventilating when things don't go as planned (which is most of the time)."
  
  HOLO_STORM_NAME:0 "Smiley, Shiney Decade"
  HOLO_STORM_DESC:0 "After the flag of the revolution was raised upon the Reichstag, it broadcast to the entire world the beginning of a new era of Hololive Idealism. The dream that peace in the world can finally be realized after centuries of war and conflict. However, a dream is just that, a dream. Not long after the Treaty of Brugg and the Geneva Agreement was signed, the world was once again thrown into chaos and uncertainty. A new organisation known as 'The Resistance' came into being to be the dramatic foil of the 'League of Hololive States' and wars were ignited across continents and homelands. Now, not one man would utter the revolutionary slogan, 'Smiley, Shiney Decade.'"
  WAT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "She seems to be okay with her fellow hololive members eating her during collaboration streams, as she reassured her fans that even if she was eaten she would respawn after an 8-second timer."
  MIK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Miko is a self-proclaimed "elite" gamer who enjoys comedic drama, and tends to become emotionally attached to NPCs and inanimate objects. Fans tend to use the term "elite" ironically to highlight Miko's questionable decision-making skills. Though she specializes in role-playing games, much of the humor on her channel stems from the fact that even while playing graphic and violent games like Grand Theft Auto, she rarely takes her role seriously."
  KAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Kanata is an angelic denizen currently studying at the Heaven Academy to become a full-fledged angel. She is currently 18-years-old (though she specifies this is her "angel age", meaning in typical human years she may be far older)."
  KRN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Korone has a sweet and goofy personality that contrasts with her occasional violent and animalistic tendencies while playing certain games. She often kisses other hololive members for no reason, and has a high-pitched laugh that resembles a train whistle or flute. Like most dogs, Korone is fiercely loyal, specially to Nekomata Okayu as they are rarely seen apart, the pair is known as "OkaKoro"."
  HTO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Haato appears to be a classic tsundere who teases her fans by calling them kimo ota (creepy otaku), among other things. However, she does nothing to discourage creepy behaviors, and frequently does weird, creepy things herself; for example, using cropped NSFW fanart for video thumbnails, sniffing her own feet, and decorating her home in Animal Crossing: New Horizons with lewd drawings of herself and Tsunomaki Watame."
  OKA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Okayu is typically very relaxed, free-spirited, and also somewhat of a playboy. She sometimes flirts openly with other hololive members just to see their reactions and is also known for impulsively swiping food. She never denies her wrongdoings and was handed a guilty verdict in several "Okayu Court" cases, after which she obediently served her sentence."
  SHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Shion is a smug, cheeky brat ("kusogaki") who speaks bluntly without the usual politeness/consideration associated with the Japanese language, and flirts shamelessly with other hololive members. She wants to be seen as an adult, but thanks to her childish appearance and mannerisms, all attempts by Shion to appear adult-like end up looking very silly. She has a friendly rivalry with Minato Aqua, and the two can often be seen playing petty and mostly harmless pranks on each other."
  RIS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Risu has a humorous, high-energy and extremely friendly personality. Risu's interactions with Moona and Iofi, other hololive members and anyone in general, has given her the reputation of being exceedingly sweet, kind and personable."
