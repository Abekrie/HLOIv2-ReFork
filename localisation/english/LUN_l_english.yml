LUN_luna_himemori: "Himemori Luna"
LUN_luna_himemori_desc: "	Luna is by all definitions a traditional Russian noble who happened to find her way into the steppes of Mongolia. She rules over Mongolia with an iron fist with her military clique known as the Luknights, a collection of proud cavalrymen ranging from Russian cossacks to Mongolian rough riders.\n\nLuna and her Luknights have been in control of the Northern Steppes since the end of Hololive involvement in Russia, where her aggressive military advances and radical individualism drove a wedge between her and the Hololiver allies in Western Russia. Luna and her host of horsemen became a focal point of pan-Mongolism after the Ural Accords as she acquired independence for Mongolia and annexed Inner Mongolia from the hands of the Japanese in the chaos of the regional conflict. The Tannu Tuvas soon joined the fold shortly after which solidified Luna's Mongol nationalist policy.\n\nLuna wishes to continue expansion of her nation but is limited by both population and resources; despite her large and quick acquisition of rightful Mongolian lands, these areas remain under-industrialized and sparsely populated. The constant raiding and war have also made Luna an unpopular diplomatic partner in the region and Luna sits at a crossroads of decisions to either liberalize the nation and change the Mongolians' way of life, or embrace the path of the Khan."
