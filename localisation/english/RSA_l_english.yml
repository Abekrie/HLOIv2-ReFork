RSA_rosalyn: "Rosalyn"
RSA_rosalyn_desc: "Rosalyn is the leader of a mercantile republic based in Guangdong and Hainan. She is a massive proponent of industrialization and free market capitalism in China, especially since Guangdong is one of the most prosperous and industrialized of the HoloCNs. Alongside her HoloCN Council allies, she works to oppose Gura's rule over China and lays claim to the Mandate of Heaven.\n\nRosalyn was part of the original Hololive China branch council members who governed over the entirety of China, with her ruling over Guangdong province. However, when the HoloCN Council collapsed into civil war, Rosalyn took no sides and remained as an independent state to focus on provincial development, and only returned to the scene of foreign policy when the Japanese invaded and aided Gura in driving them out.\n\nRosalyn currently has to juggle between the pro-Chinese unification faction, largely consisting of former Guangxi Clique members who want China unified under Rosalyn, along with the pro-LHS faction who wish for greater cooperation with Gura and in turn the LHS in Belgrade. Rosalyn has a strong industry to push for change and she must make a decision for the future."
