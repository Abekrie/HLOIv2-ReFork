 SUI_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "FV M1922"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The M1922 was one of the first weapons produced after the Treaty of Brugg in 1920. Designed as a bolt action rifle, it attempted to emulate the success of the Berthier and the Lee Enfield Mk.III with a very limited degree of success. Although a significant improvement from older weapons like the Lebel, the design was uncomfortable and awkward to use when finally tested on the field during the The Great Northern War. The rifle also faced severe malfunctioning issues especially in muddy conditions such as the trenches in the Baltics and tropical climates in Africa. By the time the 1930s had arrived, defence officials were keen on finally replacing the M1922 with a more modern weapon."

 SUI_infantry_equipment_0_emergency_desc:0 "The Lebel rifle was the first firearm to use smokeless powder ammunition and featured a durable design which was capable of long range performance. However, by the 1930s, the Lebel was terribly outdated compared to other weapons on the field and was solely used when the demand for modern equipment could not have been met. Despite this, the Lebel remains a hardy, effective weapon."

 SUI_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "FV M1931"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The RSA M1931 was a direct improvement from the M1922 designed shortly after the Great War. These new arms ditched the obsolete Lebel rounds for the more modern modern 7.5×57mm cartridges and were generally more well liked than the clunky, rushed 1922 design. The M1931 was intended to be a cheap, easy to produce weapon that would finally be able to replace the M1922 and surplus French equipment from WW1. The rifle was put to the test in the English Rebellion and the Occupation of New Guinea and proved itself to be an effective weapon for its time."

 SUI_infantry_equipment_1_emergency_desc:0 "The M1922/33 was the last variant created for the M1922 in order to extend its lifespan. It featured a simplified stacking hook and adopted the same bayonet as the M1931 in order to reduce the production cost. Despite the intentions, the model only sped up the discontinuation of the M1922 series as the M1931 and its variations was shown to be superior in almost every regard. "

 SUI_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "FSA M1940"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The M1940 was the first semi-automatic rifle to be mass-produced by Suisei and utilised the smaller 7.5×54mm cartridges to reduce the risk of weapon failure but mainly to prevent the user from mistaking the RSA's 7.5×57mm with equivalents from Mauser. The M1940 was shorter than its predecesseurs the M1931 and M1922 and was easier to modify and upgrade but was more prone to malfunctioning due to its direct impingement operation. The weapon also featured a built in rifle grenade and an improved ironsight."

 SUI_infantry_equipment_2_emergency_short:0 "FV M1931/37"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_2_emergency_desc:0 "The M1931/37 was a variant built off of the M1931 for use with the new 7.5x54mm magazines that replaced the 7.5x57mm rounds. The firearm also utilized a turned-down handle and a fixed wooden stock. The model was more expensive to produce than the original M1931 but was more effective and resilient to weathering than its predecesseur. However, it was phased out prematurely due to the rapid improvements in the FSA series which was more practical for modern warfare than the FV variants."

 SUI_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The M41 was the attempt by the Suisei Armed Forced to replace the dated, Great War surplus Chauchat guns with a more reliable, effective weapon suited for modern warfare. The M41 was built in two variants, one where its ammunition was fed by a box magazines and one from a belt, with the former being prefered for offensives. It mainly utilised 7.5x54mm rounds and did not require a tripod or a team of gunners to operate, allowing it to be integrated easily into infantry squads for suppressing fire. The M41 was significantly more robust than the Chauchat; drastically reducing incidents of dust or mud entering and had a much higher cyclic rate than even other contemporary weapons used. "

The firearm was fed via a 32 round detachable box magazine which was universally despised for its malfuctions due to frequent jams. It also lacked a safety and proper stock, although some variants with a wire stock were designed later on. The weapon also faced issues of a relatively low pressure and easily bendable parts which resulted in low reliability on the field."

 SUI_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "The model M1945 was the last series of semi-automatic rifles to be produced by Suisei. Although maintaining the built in rifle grenade and 7.5x54mm cartridges, the M1940's iron sight was reserved for secondary purpose as telescopic sights were frequently attached to the weapon. This allowed for the M1945 to have a longer firing range than its predecesseurs. Solvents and lubricants were used to reduce the risk of malfunctioning that plagued the previous M1940. However, production of the weapon was limited due to the rise of superior assault rifles."

 SUI_infantry_equipment_4_emergency_short:0 "FG M43"
 SUI_infantry_equipmetn_4_emergency_desc:0 "The M43 was a last ditch weapon created by the Fabricant de Lyon. The design was a crude simplification of the FSA M40 and was only meant to see frontline action in desperate circumstances. It was primarily distributed to civilians and partisans to continue the fight in case the armed forces were to be defeated. The majority of the components in the gun were modified from pre-exisiting weapons and very few parts were precision tooled. The wood lacked a finish and the firearm was extremely prone to jamming. Nevertheless, the M43 was still a better choice than other surplus weaponry available from previous decades."

 SUI_infantry_equipment_5_desc:0 "The FA M1948 was the first assault rifle produced for the Suisei Armed Forces and was largely built on the experimental SDA (Société du Dévéloppement d'Armement) M43. It used the modern 7.65×35mm cartridges and fed via 24 round magazines. However, the weapon was originally designed to handle over 30 rounds but was cut down due to overheating issues when used at the maximum rate of fire. The length of the gun was also dramatically cut down to 905mm, much shorter than the previous M1945 and was also much lighter. Despite its positives, it was still very expensive and lacked the same firepower as other similar weapons of its time."

 SUI_infantry_equipment_6_desc:0 "The PM M1952-B was the standard submachine gun of the Suisei Armed Forces and the Gendarme. The model was a variation of the M1951 MAS, with the only prominent change being a retractable wire stock instead of a fixed wooden stock. The M1952-B was also the first weapon in Suisei's arsenal to operate off of the newly implemented, RSA 9x19mm magazines but had a much slower rate of fire than its competitors and was considerably heavier. However, despite its flaws, the M1952-B was a very reliable weapon that was superior to its predecesseurs in almost every regard."

 NOE_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The KG28k was a bolt action rifle designed by the newly formed KDG (Königliche Deutsche Gewehrfabrik) that was organized from the arms manufacturers in East Prussia, Silesia and Pommerania. The weapon was based on the Gewehr 98 but its barrel length was cut down to just 600mm and its rear sight graduated from 100m to 2,000m in 50m increments rather than the previous 100m ones. The KG28k also utilized the new Mauser 7x57mm cartridges however this was oftentimes modified for exports. The weapon's shorter length allowed it perform significantly better than its longer Fubuki counteparts while in trench warfare and its reliability convinced many other nations to use modified versions of the KG28k."

 NOE_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "KG35k"
 NOE_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The bolt action KG35k was designed to improve on the shortcomings of the KG28k. The weapon offered laminated stocks, a built in rifle grenade and increased the rear sight increments of the KG28k from 50m to 100m although the 7x57mm rounds from the previous generation remained. The rifle was quickly made the standard of the Noel army and there was an immediate effort to replace the previous decade's local and imported weapons such as the KG28k and post-war German surplus equipment with the new rifles."

The KK40k operated a short-stroke piston gas system and facillitated the transition towards 7.92x57mm rounds. The barrel length was cut down again to 550mm and replaced the previous iron sights of the KG28k and KG35k with a simpler open sight which complimented the weapons focus on close-combat and suppressing fire. The KK40k also replaced the traditional stripper clips with the modern box magazines and was lighter than previous weaponry; making it a well liked weapon amongst its various user."

 NOE_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The KMG42 was a significant improvement from the earlier KMG27 and KMG33. It was lighter, cheaper to produce, and was more resillient to the environment than its temperamental predecesseurs. It operated using the same 7.92x57mm rounds as the KK40k and was air-cooled and recoil boosted at the muzzle. Its design and reliability on the battlefield was the envy of those even on the opposing side and set the standard for modern machine guns to come."

 WTS_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The SMLE Mk III was largely a holdover rifle from the end of the Great War but was still considered a vast improvement over it's early war designs. The magazine had been improved, handguards made more comfortable, the rear sight arrangement adjusted to be more simple, a fixed charger guide replacing the previous bolt-headed sliding one, and the chamber being adapted to fire new high velocity spitzer bullets. More importantly, however, was the trademark Pattern 1907 bayonet, a one-piece, 17 inch long steel blade with a crossguard and pommel that would become vital in the conflict of the Great War."

The most controversial changes were the removal of both the magazine cut-off mechanism and the long-range volley sights. The cocking piece was changed to a serrated slab, and the windage adjustment of the rear sight was also removed."

Coming about after extensive testing on the previous British design, it was found that previous models were still far too complex and expensive to produce. While the manufacturing process was streamlined overall, new additions were also added, such as a receiver-mounted sighting system which improved sighting radius and accuracy, a "battle sight" variant that allowed set 300 and 600 yard distances, and an added band near the muzzle for increased bayonet strength."

 WTS_infantry_equipment_1_emergency_desc:0 "The SMLE Mk VI was designed to be similar in function to its previous model, yet prioritized accuracy while aiming. Introducing a new 'floating barrel' that was seperate from the forearm, this allowed the barrel to expand and contract without touching said forearm and thus keeping any interference between the sights and the alignment of the barrel from occuring. Overall the rifle could now vibrate freely without affecting one's aim. This updated variant also reintroduced the now commonplace magazine cut-off, making previous models that much more obselete."

This design saw many advantages, including the iron sight line being redesigned with a rear receiver aperture battle sight and calibrated with far better distance incriments, proving to be faster and more accurate. Overall the rifle was heavier in large part to a more solid design of the new No. 4 Bayonet. The rifle now looked notably different too with a flat left side, the chequering on it's furniture having been removed, the barrel now protruding from the end of the forestock, and the charger bridge no longer being rounded."

 WTS_armored_car_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Daimler Armoured Car, while not as widespread as it's Humber predecessor, was considered a more successful and ingenious design. It's more powerful 95 hp engine was located at the rear and linked through a fluid flywheel to a Wilson preselector gearbox. It had full independent suspension and four wheel drive. Epicyclic gearing in the wheel hubs enabled a very low ratio in bottom gear thus being able to manage 1:2 inclines. It's rugged nature combined with reliability made it ideal for reconnaissance and escort work."
