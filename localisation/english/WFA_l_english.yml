 wfa_focus.1.t: "An Army With a State"
 wfa_focus.1.desc: "Before its founding in the 1920s, the White Fox Army was an elite army of experienced and professional soldiers, loyal to Fubuki and her government in Stockholm. But when word of a coup reached the halls of parliament, the WFA was exiled to Norway and given their own territory, free to enact their own machinations and desires. Now, the WFA exists as an army with a state, ruling Norway under a strict military Junta. But behind the scenes, the visage of the regime's iron fist is a ruse. The government under Schalburg plays a delicate balance between the Anti-Fubuki Clique under Kjelstrup, and the loyalists under Kryssing. If the fragile situation were to tip in either direction, then the consequences will surely be dire for the WFA."
 wfa_focus.1.a: "The powderkeg is set to explode..."

 wfa_focus.2.t: "Whispers of a Plot"
 wfa_focus.2.desc: "Von Schalburg arrived at the war room, where other officers from the Anti-Fubuki clique had gathered. Schalburg was then let in on the plot. He would join the plotters in purging the Fubuki loyalists, then with the WFA unified they would march on Stockholm to depose Fubuki and realise their dream of a pan-Nordic state. Schalburg had a choice to make. Join them, and enact this plot, or reject it and continue to try and maintain the WFA's balance of power."
 wfa_focus.2.a: "This is a ridiculous plan, it will never succeed!"
 wfa_focus.2.b: "It is time we enact our dream of a pure Nordic land!"

 wfa_focus.35.t: "Rejecting the Madness"
 wfa_focus.35.desc: "Despite sharing similar views to them, Von Schalburg knew that this plan would not come to fruition and would backfire, undermining everything the WFA had worked to achieve. But as he left, he felt the resentment radiating from each conspirator of the plot, one side of him thinking he had crossed the wrong men..."
 wfa_focus.35.a: "“It was the right decision...wasn't it?"

 wfa_focus.3.t: "The Brigadier Plot"
 wfa_focus.3.desc: "At around 0600 hours, the residents of Oslo would awaken to armed soldiers marching down the streets and riding on trucks, heading towards the Storting building. Quickly, the rogue troops surrounded the building. Not long after, the first besiegers stormed inside with assistance from sympathetic guards inside. During the ensuing chaos as small skirmishes between loyal guards and the coup instigators erupted throughout the building, soldiers stormed into Von Schalbur's office, where he was mercilessly gunned down. In mere minutes, the violent coup ends just as soon as it begins, with Von Schalburg dead. However not everything has gone to plan. Numerous Fubuki loyalists have either fled the chaos, or were away from Oslo as the plot began, and as a result a number of them have escaped death or imprisonment. Having shattered the delicate balance of the WFA's leadership, someone has to fill in the shoes of the now deceased Schalburg, lest the country fall into anarchy."
 wfa_focus.3.a: "Karl Marthinsen, head of the Statspolitiet."
 wfa_focus.3.b: "Von Schalburg's ministers form an emergency council."

 wfa_focus.36.t: "Karl von Marthinsen Takes Charge"
 wfa_focus.36.desc: "In the aftermath of the Brigadier Plot, Karl Marthinsen, having already established himself as Chief of the Statspolitiet, decided it was his duty to uphold the rule of law in a fragmented WFA. He would then appoint himself as the new General of Norge, promising the return of stability and unity to both the people and his clique that was now incharge."
 wfa_focus.36.a: "Long live The General!"

 wfa_focus.42.t: "Throwing Off the Shackles"
 wfa_focus.42.desc: "Having maintained the delicate balance of power for too long, Von Schalburg was convinced by the radicals that now was their time to strike, throwing off the veil of loyalty to Fubuki. Joining their side, Von Schalburg has agreed to meet with them again to discuss on how to enact their plans."
 wfa_focus.42.a: "Our chains will soon be broken."

 wfa_focus.4.t: "Discussing Strategy"
 wfa_focus.4.desc: "Inside of a secret room somewhere in Oslo, Von Schalburg met with the various leaders of the Anti-Fubuki clique as they began to discuss how to enact their plans. Numerous officers advocated for a swift takeover to catch the Fubuki loyalists off guard, relying on speed and surprise. However a few others disagree, saying they must take time to prepare for the eventual takeover. In the end, the decision was left up to Von Schalburg."
 wfa_focus.4.a: "We are not ready. We must take time to plan this takeover."
 wfa_focus.4.b: "The time for waiting is over. We shall set a trap for the loyalists."

 wfa_focus.43.t: "Gathering Strength"
 wfa_focus.43.desc: "Instead of the original plan of a swift takeover, the anti-Fubuki clique has decided to go for Von Schalburg's idea of biding their time to prepare for the eventual takeover. The leaders of the plot agreed that in six months, they should have gathered enough men and material by then to enact their coup."
 wfa_focus.43.a: "Let the preparations begin."

 wfa_focus.5.t: "The Brigadier's Plot:"
 wfa_focus.5.desc: "Within the Storting Building officers and ministers gathered within one of the rooms. Von Schalburg had called an emergency meeting, but unbeknownst to these men they had just fallen for a deadly trap. When everyone was inside waiting for Von Schalburg, a hidden bomb would detonate, killing everyone inside and sending debris out onto the street below. In a single violent stroke, the most influential and powerful Fubuki loyalists have all been killed."
 wfa_focus.5.a: "A fitting end for traitors."

 wfa_focus.6.t: "Marthinsen's Discovery"
 wfa_focus.6.desc: "Across Oslo the bombing of the Storting had been portrayed as an act of terrorism committed by Pro-Fubuki rebels. However as he finalised his plans to secure the state, Von Schalburg was interrupted by an individual who still had a vast amount of influence. The chief of the Statspolitiet, Karl Marthinsen, spoke with Von Schalburg in his office where he revealed his knowledge of Von Schalburg's treachery, and the truth that the Storting Bombing was an inside job to purge the WFA of any Fubuki sympathisers. Von Schalburg tried to reason with Marthinsen in order to convince him to join his side, but Marthinsen would leave the office before Von Schalburg could stop him, not knowing that Marthinsen was off to rally what Fubuki loyalists remained."
 wfa_focus.6.a: "Should have shot him when we had the chance."

 wfa_focus.44.t: "Civil War"
 wfa_focus.44.desc: "Since being founded, the WFA has been forced to maintain a delicate power balance between rival cliques and factions, which has slowly devolved into a powder keg ready to set off. After recent internal turmoil, that powder keg has finally exploded, as rival factions have taken up arms against each other. As brother fights against brother, many wonder how the neighbouring countries will take advantage of the chaos, to further their own gains."
 wfa_focus.44.a: "God help us all..."

 wfa_focus.7.t: "Von Schalburg Assassinated"
 wfa_focus.7.desc: "As the forces of Von Schalburg and the pro-Fubuki loyalists tightened the noose around the extremists, tragedy struck. While visiting a munitions plant, Von Schalburg inspected and shook the hands of each worker, one drew a pistol and fired on the General at point blank range. This embedded agent of the extremists would not escape as the guards subdued him. But even after detaining the assassin and rushing the General to a nearby hospital, Von Schalburg could not be saved and died shortly after the attack. His death sent shockwaves across the pro-Fubuki forces, as he was on the brink of leading them to victory. They must now find a way to keep the wheels of government turning in the aftermath of this sudden death."
 wfa_focus.7.a: "A shot that rang around Scandinavia."

 wfa_focus.8.t: "Victory in the Civil War"
 wfa_focus.8.desca: "After countless hardships, blood and sacrifice the Fubuki loyalists have emerged victorious in the WFA Civil War. Supported by Fubuki herself, this clique had promised not only to rebuild the country, but rebuild their relationship with Fubuki, resulting in many praising them as bringers of peace"
 wfa_focus.8.descb: "In a shocking turn of events, the hardliners within the WFA have emerged victorious in the civil war against the Pro-Fubuki loyalists. Believing in the ideals of the original founders of the WFA, these hardliners firmly uphold the belief that they were destined to oust Fubuki and her regime to establish a pan-Nordic state around their militaristic and totalitarian views. Immediately following their victory, the new WFA regime began to mobilise along the border with Sweden, threatening to ignite a new war before the flames of civil war have even died out."
wfa_focus.8.descmart: "Against all odds, the legitimate government under Marthinsen has prevailed in the civil war. The last of the rebel forces have either been rounded up, or have fled to the Swedish border, back to Fubuki. With the state secure, Marthinsen has begun to rebuild the country under his image."
 wfa_focus.8.a: "Through struggle, our people shall find strength."

 wfa_focus.9.t: "REPLACE_ME"
 wfa_focus.9.desc: "REPLACE_ME"
 wfa_focus.9.a: "REPLACE_ME"

 wfa_focus.10.t: "Marthinsen's Discovery"
 wfa_focus.10.desc: "As preparations for the plot were half completed, a spanner was thrown into the works. Karl Marthinsen, the chief of the Statspolitiet had made the discovery of Schalburg's recent dealings and had gone to confront him about it in his office. With Marthinsen having revealed to him his knowledge of the plot, Von Schalburg was given few options, each with their own consequences."
 wfa_focus.10.a: "He stands firm, explaining his reasons to Marthinsen."
 wfa_focus.10.b: "Relenting, Von Schalburg abandons the plot."
 wfa_focus.10.c: "Von Schalburg orders his guards into the room."

 wfa_focus.11.t: "Changing Sides"
 wfa_focus.11.desc: "Upon being discovered by Marthinsen, Von Schalburg renounced his affiliation to the plotters and agreed to help Marthinsen in undoing the damage before it spiralled out of control. Von Schalburg would reveal the identities of key anti-Fubuki extremists that were part of the plot, giving Marthinsen his full support to hunt them down and detain them. As the Statpolitiet did its job, Von Schalburg would set about to rebuild the strength of the Pro-Fubuki clique to ensure that the Anti-Fubuki did not have the advantage."
 wfa_focus.11.a: "Perhaps it is not too late."

 wfa_focus.12.t: "A Violent Turn of Events"
 wfa_focus.12.desc: "When his guards entered the office, Von Schalburg expected them to carry out his orders and detain Marthinsen. However, he would be shocked when he saw his own guards turn their guns against him, followed by Marthinsen saying that he had bribed them should a situation like this occur. Before he could protest, Von Schalburg would be ruthlessly gunned down by his former guards as Marthinsen watched, before he then ordered the mess be cleaned up, and his former leader's body disposed of."
 wfa_focus.12.a: "Like Caesar, he died at the hands of his trusted men."

 wfa_focus.13.t: "Marthinsen's Scapegoats"
 wfa_focus.13.desc: "As news of Von Schalburg's death spreads across Norway, Marthinsen has placed himself as head of the investigation, with the others not knowing of his involvement. After a series of raids by the Statspolitiet, Marthinsen would show not just evidence but also signed confessions that presented the Anti-Fubuki clique as those responsible for Schalburg's death, sending shock and anger throughout Von Schalburg's ministers. With most of the government behind him, and with his enemies blamed for Schalburg's assassination, Marthinsen was set to take control of the WFA."
 wfa_focus.13.a: "A major shift after a major death."

 wfa_focus.14.t: "Von Schalburg Assassinated"
 wfa_focus.14.desc: "As the forces of Von Schalburg and the pro-Fubuki loyalists tightened the noose around the extremists, tragedy struck. While visiting a munitions plant, Von Schalburg inspected and shook the hands of each worker, one drew a pistol and fired on the General at point blank range. This embedded agent of the extremists would not escape as the guards subdued him. But even after detaining the assassin and rushing the General to a nearby hospital, Von Schalburg could not be saved and died shortly after the attack. His death sent shockwaves across the pro-Fubuki forces, as he was on the brink of leading them to victory. They must now find a way to keep the wheels of government turning in the aftermath of this sudden death."
 wfa_focus.14.a: "A shot that rang around Scandinavia."

 wfa_focus.15.t: "Formation of a New Council"
 wfa_focus.15.desc: "In the wake of Von Schalburg's assassination, a power vacuum had opened. To fill it, various ministers and advisors from Schalburg's government decided to form an emergency council to continue the duties of the regime, with Karl Marthinsen retaining his duty as chief of the Statspolitiet to restore order. This new coalition has vowed to carry on the fight and to ensure that Von Schalburg did not die in vain."
 wfa_focus.15.a: "We shall fight no matter the cost!"

 wfa_focus.17.t: "A Question of Loyalty?"
 wfa_focus.17.desc: "The new regime owes the survival of the nation to Fubuki. She provided aid to them during the Civil War, paving the way for their victory. However with stability having returned to the country, some within the new WFA government have been hesitant to rush headlong into swearing loyalty to Fubuki"
 wfa_focus.17.a: "We shall swear loyalty to our Fubuki forever!"
 wfa_focus.17.b: "Not so fast…"

 wfa_focus.18.t: "Von Schalburg Holds"
 wfa_focus.18.desc: "In a surprising move, Von Schalburg did not order the arrest of Marthinsen or back down. Instead he stood his ground and explained his reason for changing sides to Marthinsen. He told him that this delicate power balance would only prolong the inevitable and that it was the destiny of the WFA to rebel against Fubuki's shackles to realise their dream of a pure nordic land. What was equally surprising was that Marthinsen would agree with Von Schalburg, pledging his support to the eventual uprising of the anti-Fubuki clique."
 wfa_focus.18.a: "“Glad you see my reasoning."

 wfa_focus.21.t: "A Split In Leadership!"
 wfa_focus.21.desc: "Not all had accepted Karl Marthinsen appointing himself as General of Norge. Decorated officer Kund Borge Martinsen would declare he was the rightful General of Norge, and that Karl's appointment was illegitimate citing that a police chief was not fit to rule the WFA."
 wfa_focus.21.a: "Arrest him!"
 wfa_focus.21.b: "We'll see about that…"

 wfa_focus.22.t: "Mass Resignations - The Sverige Government"
 wfa_focus.22.desc: "Following the arrest of Kund Martinsen, a substantial number of ministers, many of whom were loyal to Fubuki, would resign from their posts in the WFA government, fleeing over the border to Sverige shortly after."
 wfa_focus.22.a: "We didn't need those traitors anyways."

 wfa_focus.23.t: "Further Crackdowns"
 wfa_focus.23.desc: "With his main opponent now in prison and a number of the government's Fubuki loyalists fleeing over the border, Karl Marthinsen would set about to further secure his reign. Fearing that further defectors would give Fubuki vital intelligence on the WFA, Mathinsen would initiate further crackdowns on any suspected dissent within the WFA's ranks."
 wfa_focus.23.a: "The state is secured."

 wfa_focus.24.t: "Fubuki Demands We Reaffirm Our Oath"
 wfa_focus.24.desc: "For years Fubuki and her government have been a thorn in the side of the WFA's ambitions. A message sent to Marthinsen has proven this ever prevalent, as in the event of the recent change in leadership, Fubuki has demanded that Marthinsen and the WFA reaffirm their oaths of vassalage."
 wfa_focus.24.a: "Fine."
 wfa_focus.24.b: "Damn you!"

 wfa_focus.25.t: "War!"
 wfa_focus.25.desc: "In defiance of Fubuki's demands of vassalage, the leaders of the WFA instead have declared their full independence from Fubuki. As a result, reports of troops crossing the border from Sweden have flooded into Oslo, followed by the WFA announcing the start of hostilities, and have called for a general mobilisation. The war to decide the fate of the Nordic lands has begun."
 wfa_focus.25.a: "Only one shall survive..."

 wfa_focus.37.t: "The Power Struggle Begins"
 wfa_focus.37.desc: "Rather than simply getting rid of his opponent, Marthinsen instead decided to compete with Borge Matinsen at his own game. Confident that he could win over the support of his ministers and generals, Karl Marthinsen dismissed Kund as an ambitious nobody whom he can easily beat."
 wfa_focus.37.a: "May the best man win."

 wfa_focus.28.t: "Marthinsen Challenges the Council"
 wfa_focus.28.desc: "When the Council took control of the WFA, there were some who questioned their effectiveness of ruling the country. The most vocal critics being Karl Marthinsen, chief of the Statspolitiet. Marthinsen's actions have not gone beyond vocal criticism and slander, but the council has grown concerned due to Marthinsen's position and connections."
 wfa_focus.28.a: "Arrest him!"
 wfa_focus.28.b: "He has done nothing wrong."

 wfa_focus.29.t: "Civil War!"
 wfa_focus.29.desc: "Since being founded, the WFA has been forced to maintain a delicate power balance between rival cliques and factions, which has slowly devolved into a powder keg ready to set off. After recent internal turmoil, that powder keg has finally exploded, as rival factions have taken up arms against each other. As brother fights against brother, many wonder how the neighbouring countries will take advantage of the chaos, to further their own gains."
 wfa_focus.29.a: "God help us all..."

 wfa_focus.39.t: "Marthinsen Arrested"
 wfa_focus.39.desc: "In a cruel twist of irony, Karl Marthinsen who had ordered the arrest of dozens of suspected disloyal individuals had found himself in cuffs. Once the chief of the Statspolitiet, Marthinsen was now on trial for charges of disloyalty, subversion, and perhaps even treason. But the arrest of such a powerful man was sure to have dire consequences."
 wfa_focus.39.a: "It was for the greater good."

 wfa_focus.40.t: "Hardliners Rebel!"
 wfa_focus.40.desc: "In the days following Marthinsen's arrest, the Council has presumed that its hold on the WFA was now secure. However reporting coming in from across the country would prove them wrong. Hardliners within the WFA have staged a number of uprisings in cities across Norway, and have begun their march on Oslo, to finish what the Brigadier's plot had started and place an anti-Fubuki clique into power."
 wfa_focus.40.a: "Those traitors shall pay!"

 wfa_focus.30.t: "A Rebellion Exposed"
 wfa_focus.30.desc: "Despite disagreements with its leadership, Marthinsen has proved himself a useful man for the Council to keep around. This was most evident when Marthinsen and the Statspolitiet had uncovered a plot by radical members of the WFA to stage a revolution against the Council. Immediately, the Statspolitiet was dispatched to arrest the conspirators, but some had managed to escape. Regardless, the plans of these radicals have been significantly hindered, thanks to the Council choosing to keep Marthinsen."
 wfa_focus.30.a: "Rationality paid off in the end."

 wfa_focus.41.t: "Hardliners Rebel!"
 wfa_focus.41.desc: "Despite mass arrests and investigations, hardliners within the WFA have staged a small number of uprisings in cities across Norway, and have begun their march on Oslo, to finish what the Brigadier's plot had started and place an anti-Fubuki clique into power"
 wfa_focus.41.a: "Those traitors shall pay!"

 wfa_focus.31.t: "Marthinsen's Putsch"
 wfa_focus.31.desc: "With progress in the civil war having ceased, the ever vocal opponent of the Council, Karl Marthinsen, has decided to act. In a radio speech broadcasted across Oslo, Marthinsen has declared the ruling Council as weak and incapable of returning stability to the country, as hundreds of Statspolitiet officers marched towards the Storting building."
 wfa_focus.31.a: "The city police and national guard hold off the coup, and the Council escapes"
 wfa_focus.31.b: "The city police and national guard stand neutral, and the Council is captured"
 wfa_focus.31.c: "The city police and national guard turn on the Council, and they are gunned down."

 wfa_focus.32.t: "Marthinsen Defects"
 wfa_focus.32.desc: "After the failed putsch, Marthinsen and those loyal to him have escaped from Oslo. After some time, it has been discovered that he and his followers have defected to the extremists, and in exchange for providing him with a field position, Marthinsen has promised to give the WFA rebels his knowledge on the opposition's inner workings."
 wfa_focus.32.a: "That glorified policeman has shown his true colours"

 wfa_focus.33.t: "The Fight Goes On!"
 wfa_focus.33.desc: "With the Council having been detained, Marthinsen has taken over as new leader of the WFA. However, rather than sign a deal with the rebels, Marthinsen has instead decided to carry on the fight, saying that he will uphold his duty to restore law and order rather than side with a group of radicals."
 wfa_focus.33.a: "The rule of law remains."

 wfa_focus.34.t: "They Are Gunned Down"
 wfa_focus.34.desc: "In the aftermath of the Council's violent end, surprising news has arrived from the WFA extremists. With most of the Pro-Fubuki Council now dead, the extremists have stated their intentions to lay down their arms and peacefully rejoin the WFA, now under the command of Marthinsen."
 wfa_focus.34.a: "Through violence, peace has been restored."

 wfa_focus.38.t: "Von Schalburg's Advisors Take Command"
 wfa_focus.38.desc: "In the wake of Von Schalburg's assassination, a power vacuum had opened. To fill it, various ministers and advisors from Schalburg's government decided to form an emergency council to restore order to the country. The council has promised to uphold Schalburg's policies of maintaining stability between the various cliques."
 wfa_focus.38.a: "The Council shall restore order!"

 wfa_focus.47.t: "The Great Purge"
 wfa_focus.47.desc: "Despite all that had been gained, Marthinsen knew that the WFA was still plagued by internal rivalries and those not truly loyal to his reign. As chief of the Statspolitiet, Marthinsen has spent years investigating potential treason in the WFA, and has retained a list of enemies, some of whom remain in the country, but also hold powerful positions within the WFA. If Marthinsen was to secure his reign, he must choose how to proceed with the purge"
 wfa_focus.47.a: "Refrain from the purges, but continue to gather evidence."
 wfa_focus.47.b: "Try a few disloyal officers and politicians. They will serve as an example."
 wfa_focus.47.c: "Investigate everyone. Leave no stone unturned."

 wfa_focus.45.t: "Rise of Kjelstrup"
 wfa_focus.45.desc: "In the aftermath of Von Schalburg's death the seat of power lay vacant for the Anti-Fubuki forces. This gave way for numerous candidates to take over the clique, with one of them being Finn Kjelstrup. A highly decorated officer and one of the original members of the Anti-Fubuki clique, Kjelstrup had always disagreed with Von Schalburg's handling of the initial uprising and later the fighting against Fubuki's loyalists. With Schalburg dead, Kjelstrup would seize power for himself and declare himself the new General of Norge."
 wfa_focus.45.a: "He shall lead us to victory!"
