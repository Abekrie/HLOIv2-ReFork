KAN_amane_kanata: "Amane Kanata"
KAN_amane_kanata_desc: "Amane Kanata is the leader of Heimin Union and one of the most famous Mexican revolutionaries. Starting her journey as a simple peasant, she managed to reach high positions in the Zapatista army, but after his refusal to cooperate with Vilia against Constitutionalists in 1915, she started her own rebellion. With the aid from Coco and Calli she united Mexico under her rule in 1920, proceeding to enact land reform and start slow industrialisation of the country, despite the protests of peasantry-oriented members of the government. To finance these large scale reforms she took credits from Coco, predicting that modernisation of the country would bring needed profits to repay them. But in actuality, such transformation turned out to be much slower and expensive than she planned, defaulting on her debt in 1934. To guarantee the return of her investments, Coco invaded Heimin Union, occupying its northern lands and port city of Veracruz, promising to return control when Kanata returns her money. Humiliated, Kanata turned for help to Aqua, who provided needed assistance to stabilize the country. Now, she gathers her strength to get a grip over her dire situation and destroy all those who stand in the way of Mexican people."

kanata.1.t: "Return to Civil War"
kanata.1.desc: "Disturbing news has emerged from the countryside. Various antis had begun rising up against Kanata's government, seizing various towns, cities and military garrisons along with their stockpiles of weapons. As supporters of this rebellion flooded the streets of Mexico City, soldiers and police officers were able to help Kanata escape just before the National Palace was over-run."
kanata.1.a: "Long Live El Angel!"

kanata.2.t: "Aqua Abandons Us"
kanata.2.desc: "In the ongoing Veracruz Crisis, we had taken a heavy hit as Aqua rescinded her support for our country. Without the backing of the revolutionary Resistance, we can only depend on the LHS to protect us from Coco."

kanata.2.b: "Forget it, we'll retake our patrimony by force!"
kanata.2.c: "There has to be another way..."

kanata.3.t: "Yagoo's Conditions"
kanata.3.desc: "Yagoo has made an agreement to help us retake Northern Mexico and Veracruz from Coco but with a caveat; he wants us to shift our government policies to be more LHS oriented and transition into a full democracy. While we would get Yagoo's help, doing so would be incredibly dangerous and surround us in Resistance territory. Moreover, we will severely damage our reputation with Aqua."
kanata.3.a: "We have no choice but to accept..."
kanata.3.b: "Is this some sort of sick joke!?"

kanata.4.t: "Coco Backs Down"
kanata.4.desc: "Coco has backed down from military confrontation when we moved troops to the border of Northern Mexico and Veracruz. It seems that she's nothing more than a paper dragon."

kanata.4.b: "Time to deal with another occupation..."

kanata.5.t: "Yagoo Agrees"
kanata.5.desc: "Yagoo has agreed to hand over Baja California to us."
kanata.5.a: "That was easy"

kanata.6.t: "Yagoo Refuses"
kanata.6.desc: "Yagoo has refused to hand over Baja California to us. Is this grounds for war?"
kanata.6.a: "So much for self-determination"

kanata.7.t: "Yagoo Backs Down"
kanata.7.desc: "Yagoo has unfortunately backed down and rescinded his offer of helping us against Coco to reclaim our lost territories. It seems like we'll have to turn to Aqua or deal with this on our own..."
kanata.7.a: "Yagoo you Bastard!"
kanata.7.b: "Aqua you Bastard!"
kanata.7.c: "Forget it, our army will show Coco!"

kanata.8.t: "Yagoo Asks for Our Participation"
kanata.8.desc: "Yagoo has asked us if we can join his war against Kiryu Coco. This could be the opportunity we need to retake Northern Mexico and Veracruz."
kanata.8.a: "Why of course we'll join"
kanata.8.b: "Uhh...give us a moment to prepare"

kanata.9.t: "Coco Returns Our Lands"
kanata.9.desc: "Coco has agreed to return Northern Mexico and Veracruz to us. We're fortunate that we're able to get our land back without spilling any blood. Moreover we now work on rebuilding relations with Coco."
kanata.9.a: "The people united will never be defeated!"

kanata.10.t: "Coco Refuses to Return Our Land"
kanata.10.desc: "Coco has refused to return Northern Mexico and Veracruz to us. We really can't trust that dragon…"
kanata.10.a: "Puta! Diabla! Vagabunda...!"

kanata.11.t: "Guerra Peninsular - Success"
kanata.11.desc: "Our border conflict gambit in Baja California is successful and the LHS has folded, giving us control of the region."
kanata.11.a: "Shows the decadence of the Yagooists"

kanata.11.t: "Guerra Peninsular - Failure"
kanata.11.desc: "Our border conflict gambit in Baja California has unfortunately failed and we only ended up with lost men and equipment."
kanata.11.a: "Damn!"
