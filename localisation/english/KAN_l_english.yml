KAN_amane_kanata: "Amane Kanata"
KAN_amane_kanata_desc: "Amane Kanata is the leader of Heimin Union and one of the most famous Mexican revolutionaries. Starting her journey as a simple peasant, she managed to reach high positions in the Zapatista army, but after his refusal to cooperate with Vilia against Constitutionalists in 1915, she started her own rebellion. With the aid from Coco and Calli she united Mexico under her rule in 1920, proceeding to enact land reform and start slow industrialisation of the country, despite the protests of peasantry-oriented members of the government. To finance these large scale reforms she took credits from Coco, predicting that modernisation of the country would bring needed profits to repay them. But in actuality, such transformation turned out to be much slower and expensive than she planned, defaulting on her debt in 1934. To guarantee the return of her investments, Coco invaded Heimin Union, occupying its northern lands and port city of Veracruz, promising to return control when Kanata returns her money. Humiliated, Kanata turned for help to Aqua, who provided needed assistance to stabilize the country. Now, she gathers her strength to get a grip over her dire situation and destroy all those who stand in the way of Mexican people."
