IOF_airani_iofifteen_desc: "Airani Iofifteen is one of the primary opponents of the Moona administration in Indonesia. As an artist and a high noble, she wishes to install a monarchy in Indonesia to finally stabilize the country.\n\nIofi came to the past and was adopted by a wealthy Dutch family with strong ties to the royal family and big industry in the Netherlands which developed her monarchist views. Despite the Dutch upbringing she is pro-independence for Indonesia and organized numerous militias and mercenary groups to help overthrow the Dutch colonial government at the onset of the Hololive Revolution. She continued to maintain strong pro-LHS ties post revolution and was the leader of the 1st HoloID Republic but collapsed due to its instability. When Moona was elected in the 2nd HoloID Republic, Iofi was one of the most staunch opponents, who was against Moona's pro-Usada policies, wishing to stick with the LHS.\n\nIofi needs to leverage LHS support and her army of well trained mercenaries to win out the civil war in Indonesia. Despite her wealth and noble title her local support is rather limited so she must win more local Indonesians over to her side to bolster her ranks."
