  HOLO_STORM_NAME: "Smiley, Shiney Decade"
  HOLO_STORM_DESC: "After the flag of the revolution was raised upon the Reichstag, it broadcast to the entire world the beginning of a new era of Hololive Idealism. The dream that peace in the world can finally be realized after centuries of war and conflict. However, a dream is just that, a dream. Not long after the Treaty of Brugg and the Geneva Agreement was signed, the world was once again thrown into chaos and uncertainty. A new organisation known as 'The Resistance' came into being to be the dramatic foil of the 'League of Hololive States' and wars were ignited across continents and homelands. Now, not one man would utter the revolutionary slogan, 'Smiley, Shiney Decade.'"

  YAG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The Cover Confederacy, known colloquially as Yagooslavia, was pushed into the spotlight after the Belgrade Declaration in 1919 united the territories of Yagoo, A-Chan and Hitomi Chris under one collective leadership. Being one of the leading nations in the Treaty of Brugg and the Geneva Agreement allowed Yagooslavia to expand its influence dramatically within the Hololive world and by 1927, formalized the 'League of Hololive States' which granted more power towards the nation. Despite its aging fleet and infrastructire, the Cover Confederacy still stands out as a great power with clear global hegemony over the current status quo."

  SUB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Originating from the Benelux, the Subatomo Federation is a multi-ethnic parliamentary monarchy, made up of Dutch, French, Germans, Ashkenazi and more, which is bound together by the rule of law set by Subaru and her advisors in 1920 which ensured the pre-existing systems of democracy and freedom of the press in the region. Although its shipping industry was mauled during the early 1930s, the federation stil has a much stronger economy, standard of living and confidence level in their government than other Hololive states. Combined with a sizeable, modern military; the Subatomo Federation is easily one of the most influential nations within the LHS."

  GAW_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Chinese history has been dominated by foreign barbarians entering the Mandate of Heaven and claiming it for themselves as they assimilate into Chinese Han culture. This was exactly the case in 1931 as Gura took control of the practicaly dead HoloCN Federation. Gura came to China barely knowing any Chinese and being subordinate to all her pre-established partners. With LHS assistance and her charisma however, she managed to overcome all odds and simultaneously defeated all her former friends and foes alike. What she was left with was a country that had almost fully recovered from the Century of Humiliation and had a growing industry, improving army and a fledgling navy and airforce. Gura however still faces massive issues and must overcome them if she wishes to maintain her dominance over China."
  
  CPG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Grassroots popular movement, or Japanese plot to undermine Chinese unity? The truth lies somewhere in the middle. However it is abundantly clear that whatever the case may be, the Chinese Provisional Government's aim of reuniting China under a non-Hololive banner has been at least somewhat successful; being able to kick the Hololivers out of Hebei Province and crush their disorganized and often divided opponents. The CPG's success now ultimately relies on their continued internal stability and grit to keep fighting against all odds."

  ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The English antis, despite their claim to the greatest empire since anciant Rome, remain bickering and weak against the Hololivers; only managing to survive the initial phase of their evolution due to sheer ineptitude on a scale that would be impossible to repeat. The English antis must quickly get their act together, lest they wish to only remain in the history books as just another failed anti-Hololive movement. "

  GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Germany in the early 1910s had come close to if not fully surpassed almost every other great power of its time. Now, Germany remains divided, shattered or absorbed into smaller states or larger nearby empires. Germany today has 3 claimants as its successor: Kiara, Noel and the German Revolutionary Council, located in East Germany. This Revolutionary Council was birthed after the de facto end of the LHS Occupation Zone after the Great Norhtern War and remains unrecognized by any serious global power. The Revolutionary Council must now fight for its survival as its neighbours turn their attention to the destabilizing environment of the region."

  AQA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "When you think of a revolutionary, a shy and socially awkward individual may be the last person you may think of as the unifying force of the most influential figure of the resistance. Yet in Brazil, this is evidently the case. Chairman of the Communist Party, President of the Republic, President of the Chamber of Deputies and Vice-Secretary of the Communist Party were all positions that Minato Aqua had performed in with incredible efficiency despite all odds and attitudes at the time. Also being the backbone of Resistance thought and the leading figure of the Resistance against the LHS, Aqua is nobody to be scoffed at. Successfully initiating the first steps of mass industrialisation and land reform, now Aqua must deal with the ever nearing conflict with the LHS that she must prepare for or die failing to."

  COC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The greatest threat to onself often comes from within. This is what has been plagueing the resistance since its foundation in opposition to the LHS. Rather than being the united from against the evils of Yagooism, the Resistance is divided into the pro-Aqua and pro-Coco faction which aim to achieve ideological dominance over each other. The pro-Coco faction, led by Kiryu Coco, embraces the idea of survival of the fittest, and aims to crush the Yagooists and their supporters by the militarisation of society and expansion of Empire. Despite this rhetoric, Coco herself has been hesitant to expand the borders of the Southern United States. Coco must now decide whether to confront her North American enemies directly, or adopt Aqua's doctrine of proxy wars and revolutions."

  HTO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "In 1916, Akai Haato was arrested by the Australian authorities. This transformed Haato from a cheerful if not odd individual into a complete 'maniac' who seemed hellbent on world domination. From that point she was only known as 'Haachama'. Soon after her takeover of Australia, she proceeded to launch wars of expansion into New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, the Phillipines and Indonesia. The latter two being stalled by fierce resistance from local and foreign forces alike who wish to put an end to Haachama's reign of terror. Haachama must now resist these powers and show the world that the fledgling power means business."

  WTS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Born from the ashes of the former British Empire, Watson clings onto whatever power and glory remains of what was the greatest empire to exist since those of antiquity. In 1916, as the Verdun Treaty was signed, Watson and her supporters rose up and crushed the British Home Guard and loyalist forces. Rather than bringing forth a new age of glory under the principles of Yagooism, Britain slipped into decadence. The wealth generated over 100 years of peace had been wiped out in less than a decade. Factories remain shut after the war. In many villages, only children, the sickly and the elderly remained in the ruins of their former homes and the confidence that built Britain died with its empire. The following decade after the Great War was marred by a permanent state of recession as the National Teammates Front slowly slipped from popularity in favor of the New Nationalist movement. This movement with inspiration from their Italian counterparts successfully revolted in 1931 where they almost overwhelmed the pro-Watson forces. Watson was only saved by the LHS who rushed to save her from the brink of collapse. Following the Great Scare and total collapse of the British economy however, the two sides signed an armistice. Now, Antis and Yagooists alike wait for the fighting to fire up once again."

  NOE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "All the way back in 1920, Noel through the Treaty of Brugg had obtained the Baltics, Pomerania and East Prussia. This essentially German dominated state was one that effectively rotated the clock back to the pre-modern era. In order to raise an effective army that skirted the restrictions of the Geneva Agreement, prominant landlords were allowed to establish armies that were to be rented out by the government during times of war. This time drew close in 1931, when the Landtag procalimed Noel as the Empress of Germany to counter Kiara's coronation. Then in 1932, Noel broke the Yagooist system that existed in Europe by invading Kronii's Polish dictatorship. This kicked off the Great Northern War which saw Noel crush Poland and resist Fubuki's pushes from the Baltics. An armistice was then signed in late 1932. The two sides cautiously observing each other ever since."

  FBK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Rather than waiting around for women's sufferage, Fubuki decided to disguise her identity in order to serve as an officer in the Russian army. This brought her into battles against the Japanese, Persians, Communists and eventually, the Germans in 1912. After a series of failures, Fubuki was relieved of command and was sent to Finland where she spent some time before her enlistment. When the Russian Empire fell apart and Finland subsequently broke free, Fubuki once again fought against Red forces and through clever negotiations brought Finland and Sweden into a union. This was a springboard for Fubuki's political career as she eventually became the most powerful (wo)man in the country. It was not long after the Great Northern War that Fubuki had declared herself to be Empress of Scandinavia."

  WFA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The White Fox Army had its origins as part of the pro-Fubuki White forces in Finland fighting in the civil war. These units were soon consolidated into the '1st Jaeger Division' which lead the successful charge into Northern Russia. This was only the first of many conflicts to come. In 1918, Denmark and Norway invaded Sweden-Finland in order to restore Fubuki's fledgling dictatorship. This was only met by destruction by the hands of the 1st Jaeger as they easily out-manoeuvred and out-firepowered the opposing forces. As the war finished, 1st Jaeger ballooned again into the White Fox Army; a professional and reliable fighting force of elite soldiers. As the Great Northern War saw the failure and Balkanization of the WFA into numerous cliques, the WFA seems to be on its death bed."

  ALO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "During the Great War, the hundreds of years of Habsburg domination in Central Europe came to a sudden end. Not with an epic last stand, but a whimper as each ethnic group within the Empire tore it apart in an attempt to gain as much soil for its people as possible. As the soldiers returned home disheartened from years of fighting, they attached themselves to mass movements which wrestled power from the fledgling post-Habsburg world. One of these was the New Nationalist movement in Aloe's Hungary. Hungary after the war had fallen into economic ruin and the old liberal elite was replaced by a class which was angry that the idea of Greater Hungary failed to materialise. Now, Aloe must deal with the movement at its boiling point as armed conflict seems unavoidable."

  SUI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Starting off as a measely bandit, Suisei soon found herself as the Empress of France; the greatest ever seen since Napoleon. Like Napoleon however, she soon found herself on the back foot against a united Hololive coalition which aimed to cut her down from her high of imperial power. Soon after, her army was crushed, a democratic government was established and her royal authority was reduced to merely being a figurehead. This decade of humiliation at the hands of the parliament slipped away at the turn of the 1930s when both extremes of the poltiical spectrum failed to fix France's struggling economy. Now, the time is right for Suisei to assert her authority once again."
