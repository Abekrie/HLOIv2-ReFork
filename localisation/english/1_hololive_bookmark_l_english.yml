  HOLO_STORM_NAME: "Smiley, Shiney Decade"
  HOLO_STORM_DESC: "After the flag of the revolution was raised upon the Reichstag, it broadcast to the entire world the beginning of a new era of Hololive Idealism. The dream that peace in the world can finally be realized after centuries of war and conflict. However, a dream is just that, a dream. Not long after the Treaty of Brugg and the Geneva Agreement was signed, the world was once again thrown into chaos and uncertainty. A new organisation known as 'The Resistance' came into being to be the dramatic foil of the 'League of Hololive States' and wars were ignited across continents and homelands. Now, not one man would utter the revolutionary slogan, 'Smiley, Shiney Decade.'"

  YAG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The Cover Confederacy, known colloquially as Yagooslavia, was pushed into the spotlight after the Belgrade Declaration in 1919 united the territories of Yagoo, A-Chan and Hitomi Chris under one collective leadership. Being one of the leading nations in the Treaty of Brugg and the Geneva Agreement allowed Yagooslavia to expand its influence dramatically within the Hololive world and by 1927, formalized the 'League of Hololive States' which granted more power towards the nation. Despite its aging fleet and infrastructire, the Cover Confederacy still stand out as a great power with clear global hegemony over the current status quo."

  SUB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Originating from the Benelux, the Subatomo Federation is a multi-ethnic parliamentary monarchy, made up of Dutch, French, Germans, Ashkenazi and more, which is bound together by the rule of law set by Subaru and her advisors in 1920 which ensured the pre-existing systems of democracy and freedom of the press in the region. Although its shipping industry was mauled during the early 1930s, the federation stil has a much stronger economy, standard of living and confidence level in their government than other Hololive states. Combined with a sizeable, modern military; the Subatomo Federation is easily one of the most influential nations within the LHS."

  GAW_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "All started with a single 'A'. The crowds roared."
