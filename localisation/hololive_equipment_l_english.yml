 SUI_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "FV M1922"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The M1922 was one of the first weapons produced after the Treaty of Brugg in 1920. Designed as a bolt action rifle, it attempted to emulate the success of the Berthier and the Lee Enfield Mk.III with a very limited degree of success. Although a significant improvement from older weapons like the Lebel, the design was uncomfortable and awkward to use when finally tested on the field during the The Great Northern War. The rifle also faced severe malfunctioning issues especially in muddy conditions such as the trenches in the Baltics and tropical climates in Africa. By the time the 1930s had arrived, defence officials were keen on finally replacing the M1922 with a more modern weapon."

 SUI_infantry_equipment_0_emergency_short:0 "Fusil M1886"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_0_emergency_desc:0 "The Lebel rifle was the first firearm to use smokeless powder ammunition and featured a durable design which was capable of long range performance. However, by the 1930s, the Lebel was terribly outdated compared to other weapons on the field and was solely used when the demand for modern equipment could not have been met. Despite this, the Lebel remains a hardy, effective weapon."

 SUI_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Fusil à Verou Royal Société d’Armement Modèle 1931"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "FV M1931"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The RSA M1931 was a direct improvement from the M1922 designed shortly after the Great War. These new arms ditched the obsolete Lebel rounds for the more modern modern 7.5×57mm cartridges and were generally more well liked than the clunky, rushed 1922 design. The M1931 was intended to be a cheap, easy to produce weapon that would finally be able to replace the M1922 and surplus French equipment from WW1. The rifle was put to the test in the English Rebellion and the Occupation of New Guinea and proved itself to be an effective weapon for its time."

 SUI_infantry_equipment_1_emergency_short:0 "FV M1922/33"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_1_emergency_desc:0 "The M1922/33 was the last variant created for the M1922 in order to extend its lifespan. It featured a simplified stacking hook and adopted the same bayonet as the M1931 in order to reduce the production cost. Despite the intentions, the model only sped up the discontinuation of the M1922 series as the M1931 and its variations was shown to be superior in almost every regard. "

 SUI_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Fusil Semi-Automatique Royal Société d’Armement Modèle 1940"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "FSA M1940"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The M1940 was the first semi-automatic rifle to be mass-produced by Suisei and utilised the smaller 7.5×54mm cartridges to reduce the risk of weapon failure but mainly to prevent the user from mistaking the RSA's 7.5×57mm with equivalents from Mauser. The M1940 was shorter than its predecesseurs the M1931 and M1922 and was easier to modify and upgrade but was more prone to malfunctioning due to its direct impingement operation. The weapon also featured a built in rifle grenade and an improved ironsight."

 SUI_infantry_equipment_2_emergency:0 "Fusil à Verou Royal Société d’Armement Modèle 1931/37"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_2_emergency_short:0 "FV M1931/37"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_2_emergency_desc:0 "The M1931/37 was a variant built off of the M1931 for use with the new 7.5x54mm magazines that replaced the 7.5x57mm rounds. The firearm also utilized a turned-down handle and a fixed wooden stock. The model was more expensive to produce than the original M1931 but was more effective and resilient to weathering than its predecesseur. However, it was phased out prematurely due to the rapid improvements in the FSA series which was more practical for modern warfare than the FV variants."

 SUI_infantry_equipment_3:0 " Fusil-mitrailleur Royal Société d’Armement Modèle 1941"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "FM M41"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The M41 was the attempt by the Suisei Armed Forced to replace the dated, Great War surplus Chauchat guns with a more reliable, effective weapon suited for modern warfare. The M41 was built in two variants, one where its ammunition was fed by a box magazines and one from a belt, with the former being prefered for offensives. It mainly utilised 7.5x54mm rounds and did not require a tripod or a team of gunners to operate, allowing it to be integrated easily into infantry squads for suppressing fire. The M41 was significantly more robust than the Chauchat; drastically reducing incidents of dust or mud entering and had a much higher cyclic rate than even other contemporary weapons used. "

 SUI_infantry_equipment_3_emergency:0 "Pistolet de Guèrre Fabricant d'Auvergne Modèle-40A"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_3_emergency_short:0 "PG M40A"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_3_emergency_desc:0 "The PG M40A was an inexpensive, easy to produce submachine gun which was designed by the Fabricant d'Auvergne in order to distribute to partisans, the Gendarme, military police and other non-frontline operatives. The firearm was fed via a 32 round detachable box magazine which was universally despised for its malfuctions due to frequent jams. It also lacked a safety and proper stock, although some variants with a wire stock were designed later on. The weapon also faced issues of a relatively low pressure and easily bendable parts which resulted in low reliability on the field."
 
 SUI_infantry_equipment_4:0 "Fusil Semi-Automatique Royal Société d’Armement Modèle 1945"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_4_short:0 "FSA M1945"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "The model M1945 was the last series of semi-automatic rifles to be produced by Suisei. Although maintaining the built in rifle grenade and 7.5x54mm cartridges, the M1940's iron sight was reserved for secondary purpose as telescopic sights were frequently attached to the weapon. This allowed for the M1945 to have a longer firing range than its predecesseurs. Solvents and lubricants were used to reduce the risk of malfunctioning that plagued the previous M1940. However, production of the weapon was limited due to the rise of superior assault rifles."

 SUI_infantry_equipment_4_emergency:0 "Fusil de Guèrre Fabricant de Lyon Modèle 43"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_4_emergency_short:0 "FG M43"
 SUI_infantry_equipmetn_4_emergency_desc:0 "The M43 was a last ditch weapon created by the Fabricant de Lyon. The design was a crude simplification of the FSA M40 and was only meant to see frontline action in desperate circumstances. It was primarily distributed to civilians and partisans to continue the fight in case the armed forces were to be defeated. The majority of the components in the gun were modified from pre-exisiting weapons and very few parts were precision tooled. The wood lacked a finish and the firearm was extremely prone to jamming. Nevertheless, the M43 was still a better choice than other surplus weaponry available from previous decades."

 SUI_infantry_equipment_5:0 "Fusil d'Assaut Royal Société d’Armement Modèle 1948"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_5_short:0 "FA M1948"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_5_desc:0 "The FA M1948 was the first assault rifle produced for the Suisei Armed Forces and was largely built on the experimental SDA (Société du Dévéloppement d'Armement) M43. It used the modern 7.65×35mm cartridges and fed via 24 round magazines. However, the weapon was originally designed to handle over 30 rounds but was cut down due to overheating issues when used at the maximum rate of fire. The length of the gun was also dramatically cut down to 905mm, much shorter than the previous M1945 and was also much lighter. Despite its positives, it was still very expensive and lacked the same firepower as other similar weapons of its time."

 SUI_infantry_equipment_6:0 "Pistolet Miltrailleur Royal Société d’Armement Modèle B 1952"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_6_short:0 "PM M1952-B"
 SUI_infantry_equipment_6_desc:0 "The PM M1952-B was the standard submachine gun of the Suisei Armed Forces and the Gendarme. The model was a variation of the M1951 MAS, with the only prominent change being a retractable wire stock instead of a fixed wooden stock. The M1952-B was also the first weapon in Suisei's arsenal to operate off of the newly implemented, RSA 9x19mm magazines but had a much slower rate of fire than its competitors and was considerably heavier. However, despite its flaws, the M1952-B was a very reliable weapon that was superior to its predecesseurs in almost every regard."
  
 NOE_infantry_equipment_0:0 "Kriegsgewehr Modell 28 kurz"
 NOE_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "KG28k"
 NOE_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The KG28k was a bolt action rifle designed by the newly formed KDG (Königliche Deutsche Gewehrfabrik) that was organized from the arms manufacturers in East Prussia, Silesia and Pommerania. The weapon was based on the Gewehr 98 but its barrel length was cut down to just 600mm and its rear sight graduated from 100m to 2,000m in 50m increments rather than the previous 100m ones. The KG28k also utilized the new Mauser 7x57mm cartridges however this was oftentimes modified for exports. The weapon's shorter length allowed it perform significantly better than its longer Fubuki counteparts while in trench warfare and its reliability convinced many other nations to use modified versions of the KG28k."

 NOE_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Kriegsgewehr Modell 35 kurz"
 NOE_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "KG35k"
 NOE_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The bolt action KG35k was designed to improve on the shortcomings of the KG28k. The weapon offered laminated stocks, a built in rifle grenade and increased the rear sight increments of the KG28k from 50m to 100m although the 7x57mm rounds from the previous generation remained. The rifle was quickly made the standard of the Noel army and there was an immediate effort to replace the previous decade's local and imported weapons such as the KG28k and post-war German surplus equipment with the new rifles."
 
 NOE_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Kriegskarabiner Modell 40 kurz"
 NOE_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "KK40k"
 NOE_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The KK40k was the major breakthrough of Noel's semi-automatic rifle production, being the first mass-produced weapon of its kind locally. The KK40k operated a short-stroke piston gas system and facillitated the transition towards 7.92x57mm rounds. The barrel length was cut down again to 550mm and replaced the previous iron sights of the KG28k and KG35k with a simpler open sight which complimented the weapons focus on close-combat and suppressing fire. The KK40k also replaced the traditional stripper clips with the modern box magazines and was lighter than previous weaponry; making it a well liked weapon amongst its various user."

 NOE_infantry_equipment_3:0 "Kriegsmaschinengewehr Modell 42"
 NOE_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "KMG42"
 NOE_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The KMG42 was a significant improvement from the earlier KMG27 and KMG33. It was lighter, cheaper to produce, and was more resillient to the environment than its temperamental predecesseurs. It operated using the same 7.92x57mm rounds as the KK40k and was air-cooled and recoil boosted at the muzzle. Its design and reliability on the battlefield was the envy of those even on the opposing side and set the standard for modern machine guns to come."
