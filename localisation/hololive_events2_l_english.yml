holo_news.31.d:0 "News has filtered out of Hungary. It seems that, after a series of attacks on Aloe Manoe, the western half of the nation. has risen in revolt and forced her to abdicate. Despite this, forces loyal to Aloe have fled to the other side of the Carpathians and have entrenched themselves there, while the so-called ‘antis’ have begun to arm themselves in an attempt to flush the government out entirely. With neither side willing to back down, it seems that they are both on a collision course.\nThe reactions of their immediate neighbors have been muted so far, but it is expected that support will find its way to either side of the brewing battle."
