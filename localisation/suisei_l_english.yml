Unemployment dramatically increased as wages fell even further. Entire estates were abandoned and cargo was rotting away in warehouses as the prices were not favorable to the producers.

However, failure to deal with events like the §yGreat Scare§! and their support of the the §dpro-LHS§! forces in the §yPeko-Yagoo War§! had caused them to fall to such an extent they lost a vote of no confidence against them in §y1934§!.

SUI_emergency_measures_desc:0 "It had become quite evident to the conservative coalition in power that the policy of inaction and laissez-faire capitalism had been extremely unpopular amongst the working class. Demonstrations had already broken out throughout urban centres to protest the government's lack of action in the economic crisis; despite the reassurances the coalition has given that 'all will be well'. In order to save face, many parliamentarians agreed to pass the 'Cinq Nivels' act which would allow for some government spending in order to bail out major firms and to provide some stimulous in the form of public works. This was by no means a change of policy however, and many from the Coalition Uni de Travailleurs and the Parti Nationale de Gens Communs called out the government on the bill which they said will do little to resucitate the economy. However, the bill was enough to please the Parti Libéral Démocratique who had become more keen on forming a coalition with the ruling conservatives in order to keep the more radical, populist, pro-Resistance parties out of power."
SUI_bail_out_colonies:0 "Bail Out Colonies"
SUI_bail_out_colonies_desc:0 "The colonial holdings of the Congo and Gabon had been poor shape even before the Great Scare and Depression with many colonial strikes and riots breaking out, protesting the wretched conditions in both rural and urban areas. A commission was thus formed in 1927 under order of La Reine herself, dubbed the 'Rapport des Settlements Colonials Hoshimachis', to investigate the reasons for the unrest. The investigations on the ground had finished by 1929 and the commissions findings were published a few months later. It concluded that the protests that emerged in the decade were caused by a combination of anti-colonial trade-unions gaining significant traction, depressed economic conditions that were worsened after Suisei had joined the LHS and poor government management. The at the time ruling party, CUT, had a majority in parliament and quickly publicized the findings for political gain and was a major talking point in the 1932 general elections in which the CUT had won with a coalition. However, after the Great Scare and Depression dampened the economy in the metropole, chances of a swift recovery for the colonies seemed even dimmer. The Coalition Conservatif though, realized the good press and support they would get if they supported the colonies and thus, a colonial bailout and restructuring was ordered under the general stimulous package. "

The support from the progressive parties was necessary to prevent a vote of no confidence against the coalition and a subsequent snap election that would follow it. These concessions came in the form of various stimulous packages,promised work programs and future reform after the depression was dealt with."

Although the dogma of the Coalition Conservatif had always been laissez-faire in nature, the worrying rise of resistance parties around the world had pushed many to compromise and provide bailouts for businesses of all kind, with the failing investment firms being on the top of the list."

SUI_let_them_fail_desc:0 "Despite the pleas of numerous companies and small businesses, the Coalition Conservatif stuck to their dogma and allowed laissez-faire capitalism to determine the fate of the economy. Although temporary downturns were to be expected, the coalition believed that the market will eventually bring itself back on its feet and fix itself. However, even if this was the case, the action (or lack thereof) was an extremely unpopular decision that would be able to cost the coalition its short grasp on power."
